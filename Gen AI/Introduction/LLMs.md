# What is LLMs ?
A large language model is a trained deep learning model that understands and generate text in a human like fashion.

 Large Language Models are advanced artificial intelligence models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. They use deep learning techniques, particularly transformers, to process and generate text. Examples of LLMs include models like OpenAI's GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) and Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

LLMs are good at Understanding and generating human language.

## Why we call it Large Language Model ?
Because of the size and complexity of the Neural Networks as well as the size of the dataset that it was trained on.

In case of LLM one model can be used for many tasks like text generation, machine translation, code generation, question answering, text summarization, classification, etc.
