## introduction
Hi I am Manoj Baniya , I am from Nepal and I am a Computer Engineering student in Tribhuvan University Institute Of Engineering IOE.

## my cv
I dont have my cv right now but you can view everything about me in this portfolio site easily.
I have mentioned about my tech skill, projects, experience and educaton in this portfolio.

## about me
I am a passionate Software Developer.
I love building scalable web application and staying up to date with the latest technologies.My key areas of interest include web development basically frontend and backend development. Beside web development I also like to train Deep Neural Network for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to make intelligent AI application.

## my journey of coding
I started my coding journey after I joined my Bachelor in Computer Engineering but I had interest in Technology since I was 10. I became familiar with coding couple of years ago and since then I have been hooked into it.

## My Education
I completed my Secondary Level from Nambin English Boarding School in Jhapa Nepal. High School from Devi Secondary School Jhapa Nepal where I studied Physics Mathematics and Chemistry.Then I joined Bachelor in Computer Engineering at TU IOE in 2021.

During my Computer Engineering I explored many domains in tech.

## If you have any internship or job offer for I would be happy to talk
Please contact me in my email manojbaniya474@gmail.com.

## what interests me
I love building web application which is interactive, engaging to user and scalable to handle anything.
I also like to train machine learning models especially Deep Neural Networks for common Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing task as hobby.
Besides coding I like to listen music and play musical instrument.

## my tech stack what I know about technology what programming knowledge I have
I am comfortable coding in javascript, typescipt and python programming language.
For the frontend I use tech stack React library with tailwind css for building.
For the backend I use epxress js framework for building web server and sometimes I use FastAPI.
I am familiar with both relational and non relational database system and I use mongo db and postgreSQL for that.

I also know basic devops and have basic experience with tools like Docker,git, Kubernetes and some CI CD tools.

I also use Microsoft Azure for Cloud Services and has experience in deploying web app in cloud.

I have done several personal projects and you can view at my github <link>https://github.com/manojbaniya444</link>

Some of my projects to mention are:

Project 0: Video to MP3
used FFMPEG to video processing and express for server.

Project 1. Ecommerce application
Stack: React, Express, MongoDB, Tailwind css style
- fullstack MERN Ecommerce website where user can register login view products and order and admin manages the products and orders.

Project 2. Real Time Messaging
Stack: React, Express, socket.io, mongodb database
- Real time chat application where user can chat with other logged in user.

Project 3. facebook clone
Stack: React, Firebase for backend
- facebook clone where user can post comment share stories and chat in real time with other logged in users.

Project 4. Movie website
Stack: React, Firebase, TMDB API for movie
- use can search movies and get details about the movie and also watch trailer.

## my working experience, job
I am still a fresher and have not joined any companies yet and yet to experience industry but have done some projects with friends in my college.

My machine learning and ai project during college with my friends.
College Project 1. Nepali License Plate Detection and Recognition
Domain: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, python
Trained a machine learning model to classify nepali characters and fine Tuned a YOLO model for license plate detection. Then built a tikinter app to allow user to send image or video then get the license plate characters predicted.

This was a great experience because from data collection, labeling to training models and then integrating in graphical user interface was a challenging task and was not possible without our supervisor and friends support.

College Project 2. Roman Nepali Language Ecommerce Chatbot
Domain: Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Large Language Model, Generative AI

This is our final year project at TU IOE and we explored different techniques to develop a chatbot including rule based, retrieval and generation based chatbot. In terms of developing we faced many problems like dataset for roman nepali, hardware resources to train, constraint time to complete project and also due to lack of pretrained Large Language Models in Roman Nepali Language.
