### LANGCHAIN CHAIN:

# LCEL = Langchain Expression Language (LCEL)
chain = prompt | model
prompt will pass to the model

# Chain Possibilities
chain1 -> Chain2 -> Chain3 -> .....-> Final chain

or have branch from one chain and  chain in parallel and meet in Final Chain

or have branching from one chain to multiple Final Chains


### CHAIN UNDER THE HOOD:
the core of langchain chain is RunnableLambda.
All the RunableLambda s are make chain in RunnableSequence


### PARALLEL CHAINS:

                            -> analyze 1 -> generate 1 -> content 1 ->
prompt -> model -> parser --                                        ->final
                            -> analyze 2 -> generate 2 -> content 2 => 


### Branches

chain with if else like conditional branch where only one chain will run from the multiple chains according to the conditional.
