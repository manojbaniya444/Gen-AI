       "[Document(page_content='Provided by The Internet Classics Archive.\\nSee bottom for copyright. Available online at\\n    http://classics.mit.edu//Homer/odyssey.html\\n\\nThe Odyssey\\nBy Homer\\n\\n\\nTranslated by Samuel Butler\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK I\\n\\nTell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide\\nafter he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,\\nand many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;\\nmoreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life\\nand bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save\\nhis men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating\\nthe cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from\\never reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter\\nof Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them. \\n\\nSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely\\nhome except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his\\nwife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got\\nhim into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by,\\nthere came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to\\nIthaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his\\ntroubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun\\nto pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing\\nand would not let him get home. \\n\\nNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world\\'s\\nend, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East.\\nHe had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was\\nenjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house\\nof Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that\\nmoment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon\\'s\\nson Orestes; so he said to the other gods: \\n\\n\"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing\\nbut their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to\\nAgamemnon\\'s wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he\\nknew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him\\nnot to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure\\nto take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury\\ntold him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he\\nhas paid for everything in full.\" \\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served\\nAegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did;\\nbut Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my\\nheart bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt\\nisland, far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island\\ncovered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess\\nlives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom\\nof the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth\\nasunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,\\nand keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget\\nhis home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how\\nhe may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take\\nno heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate\\nyou with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being\\nso angry with him?\" \\n\\nAnd Jove said, \"My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget\\nUlysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more\\nliberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven?\\nBear in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses\\nfor having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus\\nis son to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys;\\ntherefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him\\nby preventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together\\nand see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified,\\nfor if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then,\\nthe gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send\\nMercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up\\nour minds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca,\\nto put heart into Ulysses\\' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to\\ncall the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his\\nmother Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep\\nand oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if\\nhe can hear anything about the return of his dear father- for this\\nwill make people speak well of him.\" \\n\\nSo saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,\\nwith which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped\\nthe redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong,\\nwherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her,\\nand down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith\\nshe was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses\\' house, disguised as\\na visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear\\nin her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of\\nthe oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in\\nfront of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to\\nwait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some\\ncleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again,\\nand some cutting up great quantities of meat. \\n\\nTelemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily\\namong the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would\\nsend them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again\\nand be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among\\nthem, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for\\nhe was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance.\\nHe took her right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear.\\n\"Welcome,\" said he, \"to our house, and when you have partaken of food\\nyou shall tell us what you have come for.\" \\n\\nHe led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were\\nwithin he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a\\nstrong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy\\nfather, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which\\nhe threw a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,\\nand he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors,\\nthat she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence,\\nand that he might ask her more freely about his father. \\n\\nA maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer\\nand poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and\\nshe drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them\\nbread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the\\nhouse, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set\\ncups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and\\npoured it out for them. \\n\\nThen the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and\\nseats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids\\nwent round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with\\nwine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that\\nwere before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink\\nthey wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments\\nof a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled\\nperforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began\\nto sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers\\nthat no man might hear. \\n\\n\"I hope, sir,\" said he, \"that you will not be offended with what I\\nam going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it,\\nand all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in\\nsome wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were\\nto see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs\\nrather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he,\\nalas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes\\nsay that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see\\nhim again. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and\\nwhere you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner\\nof ship you came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what\\nnation they declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by\\nland. Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to\\nthis house, or have you been here in my father\\'s time? In the old\\ndays we had many visitors for my father went about much himself.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva answered, \"I will tell you truly and particularly all\\nabout it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians.\\nI have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign\\ntongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring\\nback copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country\\naway from the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the wooded mountain\\nNeritum. Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell\\nyou, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never\\ncomes to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly,\\nwith an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when\\nhe comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me\\nyour father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems\\nthe gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on\\nthe mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid\\nocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his\\nwill I am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak\\nas it is borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will\\nnot be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even\\nthough he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting\\nhome again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have\\nsuch a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like\\nhim about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set\\nsail for Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since\\nthat time we have never either of us seen the other.\" \\n\\n\"My mother,\" answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses, but\\nit is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son\\nto one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask\\nme, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they\\ntell me is my father.\" \\n\\nAnd Minerva said, \"There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while\\nPenelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me\\ntrue, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these\\npeople? What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a\\nwedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringing any provisions\\nof his own? And the guests- how atrociously they are behaving; what\\nriot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable\\nperson who comes near them.\" \\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Telemachus, \"as regards your question, so long as my father\\nwas here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their\\ndispleasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more\\nclosely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it\\nbetter even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before\\nTroy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting\\nwere done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\\nashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the\\nstorm-winds have spirited him away we know not wither; he is gone\\nwithout leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing\\nbut dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss\\nof my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind;\\nfor the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland\\nisland of Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself,\\nare eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to\\nmy mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not marry,\\nnor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate,\\nand before long will do so also with myself.\" \\n\\n\"Is that so?\" exclaimed Minerva, \"then you do indeed want Ulysses\\nhome again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and\\nif he is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking\\nand making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally\\nsuitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was\\nthen coming from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows\\nfrom Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would\\nnot give him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very\\nfond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will\\nhave a short shrift and a sorry wedding. \\n\\n\"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,\\nand take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge\\nyou to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take\\nmy advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your\\ncase before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors\\ntake themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother\\'s mind\\nis set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will\\nfind her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that\\nso dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon\\nyou to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men,\\nand go in quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some\\none may tell you something, or (and people often hear things in this\\nway) some heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and\\nask Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got\\nhome last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive\\nand on his way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will\\nmake for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear\\nof his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\\nall due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry\\nagain. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind\\nhow, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own\\nhouse. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard\\nhow people are singing Orestes\\' praises for having killed his father\\'s\\nmurderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your\\nmettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must\\ngo back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep\\nthem waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember\\nwhat I have said to you.\" \\n\\n\"Sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"it has been very kind of you to talk\\nto me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all\\nyou tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but\\nstay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself.\\nI will then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing;\\nI will give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsake such as\\nonly dear friends give to one another.\" \\n\\nMinerva answered, \"Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way\\nat once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it\\ntill I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give\\nme a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.\"\\n\\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had\\ngiven Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about\\nhis father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the\\nstranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors\\nwere sitting. \\n\\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as\\nhe told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva\\nhad laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his\\nsong from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase,\\nnot alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached\\nthe suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the\\nroof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. She\\nheld a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.\\n\\n\"Phemius,\" she cried, \"you know many another feat of gods and heroes,\\nsuch as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these,\\nand let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale,\\nfor it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband\\nwhom I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all\\nHellas and middle Argos.\" \\n\\n\"Mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"let the bard sing what he has a mind\\nto; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they,\\nwho makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to\\nhis own good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated\\nreturn of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs\\nmost warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the\\nonly man who never came back from Troy, but many another went down\\nas well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants;\\nfor speech is man\\'s matter, and mine above all others- for it is I\\nwho am master here.\" \\n\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\\'s saying\\nin her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,\\nshe mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her\\neyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters,\\nand prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow. \\n\\nThen Telemachus spoke, \"Shameless,\" he cried, \"and insolent suitors,\\nlet us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for\\nit is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius\\nhas; but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you\\nformal notice to depart, and feast at one another\\'s houses, turn and\\nturn about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist\\nin spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with\\nyou in full, and when you fall in my father\\'s house there shall be\\nno man to avenge you.\" \\n\\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the\\nboldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, \"The\\ngods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may\\nJove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before\\nyou.\" \\n\\nTelemachus answered, \"Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing,\\nI will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think\\nof for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches\\nand honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men\\nin Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among\\nthem; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule\\nthose whom Ulysses has won for me.\" \\n\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, \"It rests with heaven to\\ndecide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your\\nown house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man\\nin Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow,\\nI want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from?\\nOf what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you\\nnews about the return of your father, or was he on business of his\\nown? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that\\nhe was gone in a moment before we could get to know him.\"\\n\\n\"My father is dead and gone,\" answered Telemachus, \"and even if some\\nrumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed\\nsometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings\\nno heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief\\nof the Taphians, an old friend of my father\\'s.\" But in his heart he\\nknew that it had been the goddess. \\n\\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening;\\nbut when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each\\nin his own abode. Telemachus\\'s room was high up in a tower that looked\\non to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and full of\\nthought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor,\\nwent before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes had bought\\nher with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the worth\\nof twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her in his household\\nas he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed\\nfor he feared his wife\\'s resentment. She it was who now lighted Telemachus\\nto his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women\\nin the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened\\nthe door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as he took off\\nhis shirt he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it tidily up,\\nand hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which she went\\nout, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt home\\nby means of the strap. But Telemachus as he lay covered with a woollen\\nfleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage of the\\ncounsel that Minerva had given him. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK II\\n\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus\\nrose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,\\ngirded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like\\nan immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people\\nin assembly, so they called them and the people gathered thereon;\\nthen, when they were got together, he went to the place of assembly\\nspear in hand- not alone, for his two hounds went with him. Minerva\\nendowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled\\nat him as he went by, and when he took his place\\' in his father\\'s\\nseat even the oldest councillors made way for him. \\n\\nAegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience,\\nthe first to speak His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius,\\nland of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they\\nwere all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him,\\nHe had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father\\'s\\nland, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless\\ntheir father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still\\nweeping for him when he began his speech. \\n\\n\"Men of Ithaca,\" he said, \"hear my words. From the day Ulysses left\\nus there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then\\ncan it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene\\nus? Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to\\nwarn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?\\nI am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him\\nhis heart\\'s desire.\" \\n\\nTelemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for\\nhe was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of\\nthe assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,\\nturning to Aegyptius, \"Sir,\" said he, \"it is I, as you will shortly\\nlearn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved.\\nI have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn\\nyou, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak.\\nMy grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes\\nwhich have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of\\nmy excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and\\nwas like a father to every one of you; the second is much more serious,\\nand ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all\\nthe chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against\\nher will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius, asking him\\nto choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for\\nhis daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my father\\'s house,\\nsacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and\\nnever giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink.\\nNo estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward\\noff harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I\\nshall never all my days be as good a man as he was, still I would\\nindeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such\\ntreatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have\\nrespect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion.\\nFear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased\\nand turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the beginning\\nand the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and leave\\nme singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father Ulysses did some\\nwrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding\\nand abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house\\nand home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I\\ncould then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you\\nwith notices from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas\\nnow I have no remedy.\" \\n\\nWith this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into\\ntears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and\\nno one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who\\nspoke thus: \\n\\n\"Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw\\nthe blame upon us suitors? It is your mother\\'s fault not ours, for\\nshe is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four,\\nshe has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one\\nof us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she\\nsays. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set up\\na great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous\\npiece of fine needlework. \\'Sweet hearts,\\' said she, \\'Ulysses is indeed\\ndead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait- for\\nI would not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have\\ncompleted a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against\\nthe time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women\\nof the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.\\'\\n\\n\"This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her\\nworking on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick\\nthe stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three\\nyears and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was\\nnow in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing\\ntold us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she\\nhad to finish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore,\\nmake you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand-\\'Send\\nyour mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her\\nfather\\'s choice\\'; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on\\nplaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score\\nof the accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is\\nso clever. We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro,\\nAlcmena, Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing\\nto your mother, any one of them. It was not fair of her to treat us\\nin that way, and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven\\nhas now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your estate;\\nand I do not see why she should change, for she gets all the honour\\nand glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand, then,\\nthat we will not go back to our lands, neither here nor elsewhere,\\ntill she has made her choice and married some one or other of us.\"\\n\\nTelemachus answered, \"Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore\\nme from my father\\'s house? My father is abroad and we do not know\\nwhether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay\\nIcarius the large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending\\nhis daughter back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me,\\nbut heaven will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the\\nhouse will calf on the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not\\nbe a creditable thing to do, and I will have nothing to say to it.\\nIf you choose to take offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere\\nat one another\\'s houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If,\\non the other hand, you elect to persist in spunging upon one man,\\nheaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you\\nfall in my father\\'s house there shall be no man to avenge you.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and\\nthey flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own\\nlordly flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly\\nthey wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and\\nglaring death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting\\nfiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right\\nover the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each\\nother what an this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best\\nprophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and\\nin all honesty, saying: \\n\\n\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors,\\nfor I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away\\nmuch longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction,\\nnot on them alone, but on many another of us who live in Ithaca. Let\\nus then be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness before\\nhe comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be better\\nfor them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge; everything\\nhas happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set out for\\nTroy, and he with them. I said that after going through much hardship\\nand losing all his men he should come home again in the twentieth\\nyear and that no one would know him; and now all this is coming true.\"\\n\\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, \"Go home, old man, and prophesy\\nto your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these\\nomens myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about\\nin the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything.\\nUlysses has died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead\\nalong with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel\\nto the anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose\\nyou think he will give you something for your family, but I tell you-\\nand it shall surely be- when an old man like you, who should know\\nbetter, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the\\nfirst place his young friend will only fare so much the worse- he\\nwill take nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this- and in\\nthe next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you\\nwill at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. As for\\nTelemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother\\nback to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with\\nall the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till we shall\\ngo on harassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither\\nfor him, with all his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of\\nyours. You may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate\\nyou the more. We shall go back and continue to eat up Telemachus\\'s\\nestate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves off\\ntormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of expectation,\\neach vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare perfection.\\nBesides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in\\ndue course, but for the way in which she treats us.\" \\n\\nThen Telemachus said, \"Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall\\nsay no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people\\nof Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty\\nmen to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to\\nPylos in quest of my father who has so long been missing. Some one\\nmay tell me something, or (and people often hear things in this way)\\nsome heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive\\nand on his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will\\nmake for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of\\nhis death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\\nall due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make my mother marry\\nagain.\" \\n\\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor who had been a friend of\\nUlysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority\\nover the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty\\naddressed them thus: \\n\\n\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably;\\nI hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust,\\nfor there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you\\nas though he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors,\\nfor if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts,\\nand wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take\\nthe high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked\\nat the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop\\nsuch scandalous goings on-which you could do if you chose, for you\\nare many and they are few.\" \\n\\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, \"Mentor, what folly\\nis all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard\\nthing for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though\\nUlysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house,\\nand do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly,\\nwould have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon\\nhis own head if he fought against such great odds. There is no sense\\nin what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about\\nyour business, and let his father\\'s old friends, Mentor and Halitherses,\\nspeed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all- which I do not think\\nhe will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes\\nand tells him something.\" \\n\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\\nabode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.\\n\\nThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in\\nthe grey waves, and prayed to Minerva. \\n\\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me\\nsail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing.\\nI would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked\\nsuitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so.\" \\n\\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and\\nwith the voice of Mentor. \"Telemachus,\" said she, \"if you are made\\nof the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward\\nhenceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half\\ndone. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,\\nbut unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins\\nI see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men\\nas their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as\\nyou are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are\\nnot entirely without some share of your father\\'s wise discernment,\\nI look with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common\\ncause with any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense\\nnor virtue, and give no thought to death and to the doom that will\\nshortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shall perish on\\nthe same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your\\nfather was such an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship,\\nand will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about\\namong the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage;\\nsee everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal,\\nwhich is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the\\ntown and beat up volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca\\nboth old and new; I will run my eye over them for you and will choose\\nthe best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in\\ndoing as the goddess told him. He went moodily and found the suitors\\nflaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came\\nup to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own, saying,\\n\"Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in\\nword nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The Achaeans\\nwill find you in everything- a ship and a picked crew to boot- so\\nthat you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your noble\\nfather.\" \\n\\n\"Antinous,\" answered Telemachus, \"I cannot eat in peace, nor take\\npleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that\\nyou should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?\\nNow that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and\\nwhether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do you\\nall the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain though,\\nthanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and\\nmust be passenger not captain.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile\\nthe others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering\\nat him tauntingly as they did so. \\n\\n\"Telemachus,\" said one youngster, \"means to be the death of us; I\\nsuppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or\\nagain from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to\\nEphyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?\"\\n\\nAnother said, \"Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be\\nlike his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should\\nhave plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst\\nus: as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries\\nher have that.\" \\n\\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty\\nand spacious store-room where his father\\'s treasure of gold and bronze\\nlay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes\\nwere kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant\\nolive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit\\nfor a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should\\ncome home again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors\\nopening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea,\\ndaughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both\\nnight and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and said:\\n\\n\"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you\\nare keeping for my father\\'s own drinking, in case, poor man, he should\\nescape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve\\njars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn\\nleathern bags with barley meal- about twenty measures in all. Get\\nthese things put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will\\ntake everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs\\nfor the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear\\nanything about the return of my dear father. \\n\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him,\\nsaying, \"My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that\\ninto your head? Where in the world do you want to go to- you, who\\nare the one hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in\\nsome foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back\\nis turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out\\nof the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves;\\nstay where you are among your own people, and do not go wandering\\nand worrying your life out on the barren ocean.\" \\n\\n\"Fear not, nurse,\" answered Telemachus, \"my scheme is not without\\nheaven\\'s sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this\\nto my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless\\nshe hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to\\nspoil her beauty by crying.\" \\n\\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she\\nhad completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars,\\nand getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back\\nto the suitors. \\n\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape,\\nand went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet\\nat the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and\\nasked him to let her have a ship- which he was very ready to do. When\\nthe sun had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship\\ninto the water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally\\ncarry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the\\ncrew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.\\n\\nFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors\\ninto a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made\\nthem drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting\\nover their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their\\neyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice\\nof Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside. \\n\\n\"Telemachus,\" said she, \"the men are on board and at their oars, waiting\\nfor you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.\"\\n\\nOn this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When\\nthey got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side,\\nand Telemachus said, \"Now my men, help me to get the stores on board;\\nthey are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not\\nknow anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.\"\\n\\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after. When\\nthey had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,\\nMinerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel,\\nwhile Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and\\ntook their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair wind from\\nthe West, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon Telemachus\\ntold them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did\\nas he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,\\nraised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted\\ntheir white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the sail\\nbellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue water,\\nand the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then they\\nmade all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls to the\\nbrim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from\\neverlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.\\n\\nThus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night\\nfrom dark till dawn. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK III\\n\\nBut as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of\\nheaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos\\nthe city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea\\nshore to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.\\nThere were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were\\nnine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats and\\nburning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune, Telemachus\\nand his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship to anchor,\\nand went ashore. \\n\\nMinerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,\\n\"Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have\\ntaken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried\\nand how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may\\nsee what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and\\nhe will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person.\" \\n\\n\"But how, Mentor,\" replied Telemachus, \"dare I go up to Nestor, and\\nhow am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long\\nconversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one\\nwho is so much older than myself.\" \\n\\n\"Some things, Telemachus,\" answered Minerva, \"will be suggested to\\nyou by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for\\nI am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your\\nbirth until now.\" \\n\\nShe then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till\\nthey reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were\\nassembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his\\ncompany round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces\\nof meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When they\\nsaw the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and\\nbade them take their places. Nestor\\'s son Pisistratus at once offered\\nhis hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins\\nthat were lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes.\\nThen he gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine\\nfor them into a golden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting\\nher at the same time. \\n\\n\"Offer a prayer, sir,\" said he, \"to King Neptune, for it is his feast\\nthat you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink-offering,\\npass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt not that\\nhe too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without God\\nin the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an\\nage with myself, so I he handed I will give you the precedence.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and\\nproper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly began\\npraying heartily to Neptune. \"O thou,\" she cried, \"that encirclest\\nthe earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call\\nupon thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor\\nand on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people\\nsome handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you.\\nLastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the\\nmatter that has brought us in our to Pylos.\" \\n\\nWhen she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to Telemachus\\nand he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were roasted\\nand had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his portion\\nand they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had had enough\\nto eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said he, \"that our guests have done their dinner, it will be\\nbest to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you,\\nand from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail\\nthe seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man\\'s\\nhand against you?\" \\n\\nTelemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask\\nabout his father and get himself a good name. \\n\\n\"Nestor,\" said he, \"son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you\\nask whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under\\nNeritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private not\\npublic import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said\\nto have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know\\nwhat fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy,\\nbut as regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even\\nthat he is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he\\nperished, nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was\\nlost at sea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant\\nat your knees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy\\nend, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some\\nother traveller, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things\\nout of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what\\nyou saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either\\nby word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans,\\nbear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" answered Nestor, \"you recall a time of much sorrow to\\nmy mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while privateering\\nunder Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of king Priam.\\nOur best men all of them fell there- Ajax, Achilles, Patroclus peer\\nof gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a man singularly\\nfleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much more than\\nthis; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? Though\\nyou were to stay here and question me for five years, or even six,\\nI could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would\\nturn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did\\nwe try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against\\nus; during all this time there was no one who could compare with your\\nfather in subtlety- if indeed you are his son- I can hardly believe\\nmy eyes- and you talk just like him too- no one would say that people\\nof such different ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had\\nany kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council,\\nbut in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how\\nall might be ordered for the best. \\n\\n\"When however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail\\nin our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex\\nthe Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had Not all been either\\nwise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the\\ndispleasure of Jove\\'s daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel\\nbetween the two sons of Atreus. \\n\\n\"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be,\\nfor it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they\\nexplained why they had called- the people together, it seemed that\\nMenelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased Agamemnon,\\nwho thought that we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease\\nthe anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might have known that he\\nwould not prevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds\\nthey do not change them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard words,\\nwhereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the\\nair, and were of two minds as to what they should do. \\n\\n\"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching\\nmischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships\\ninto the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the\\nrest, about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We- the\\nother half- embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven\\nhad smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices\\nto the gods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however,\\ndid not yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel\\nin the course of which some among us turned their ships back again,\\nand sailed away under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon;\\nbut I, and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I\\nsaw that mischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with\\nme, and his crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos,\\nand found us making up our minds about our course- for we did not\\nknow whether to go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this\\nto our left, or inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of\\nMimas. So we asked heaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect\\nthat we should be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across\\nthe open sea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang\\nup which gave us a quick passage during the night to Geraestus, where\\nwe offered many sacrifices to Neptune for having helped us so far\\non our way. Four days later Diomed and his men stationed their ships\\nin Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never fell light from\\nthe day when heaven first made it fair for me. \\n\\n\"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything\\nabout the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were\\nlost but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports\\nthat have reached me since I have been here in my own house. They\\nsay the Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles\\' son Neoptolemus;\\nso also did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again,\\nlost no men at sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the\\nfield got safe home with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the\\nworld you live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he\\ncame to at the hands of Aegisthus- and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus\\npresently pay. See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son\\nbehind him to do as Orestes did, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer\\nof his noble father. You too, then- for you are a tall, smart-looking\\nfellow- show your mettle and make yourself a name in story.\"\\n\\n\"Nestor son of Neleus,\" answered Telemachus, \"honour to the Achaean\\nname, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through\\nall time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might\\ngrant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors,\\nwho are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no\\nsuch happiness in store for me and for my father, so we must bear\\nit as best we may.\" \\n\\n\"My friend,\" said Nestor, \"now that you remind me, I remember to have\\nheard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards\\nyou and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely,\\nor are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows\\nbut what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels\\nin full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him?\\nIf Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses\\nwhen we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so\\nopenly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she\\nwould take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would\\nsoon some of them him, forget their wooing.\" \\n\\nTelemachus answered, \"I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be\\nfar too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even\\nthough the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall\\nme.\" \\n\\nOn this Minerva said, \"Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven\\nhas a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, I\\nshould not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided\\nI could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get\\nhome quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was\\nby the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain,\\nand when a man\\'s hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no\\nmatter how fond they are of him.\" \\n\\n\"Mentor,\" answered Telemachus, \"do not let us talk about it any more.\\nThere is no chance of my father\\'s ever coming back; the gods have\\nlong since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,\\nabout which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than\\nany one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so\\nthat it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor,\\nand tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What\\nwas Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better\\na man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging\\nelsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you truly,\" answered Nestor, \"and indeed you have yourself\\ndivined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy\\nhad found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been\\nno barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would\\nhave been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a\\nwoman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness;\\nbut we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus who was\\ntaking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon\\'s\\nwife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery. \\n\\n\"At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for\\nshe was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a bard with\\nher, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for\\nTroy, that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had\\ncounselled her destruction, Aegisthus thus this bard off to a desert\\nisland and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon- after\\nwhich she went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he\\noffered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples\\nwith tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.\\n\\n\"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good\\nterms with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point\\nof Athens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman\\nof Menelaus\\' ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel\\nin rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in\\nhis hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had\\nto wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral\\nrites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed\\non as far as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and\\nmade it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided\\nhis fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians\\ndwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high\\nheadland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called\\nGortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as Phaestus the\\nsea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arter Phaestus\\nthe coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great\\nshelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and\\nwrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the\\nother five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where\\nMenelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of an alien\\nspeech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his evil deed. For\\nseven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and\\nthe people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year Orestes\\ncame back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his\\nfather. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of\\nfalse Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very\\nday Menelaus came home, with as much treasure as his ships could carry.\\n\\n\"Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far\\nfrom home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your\\nhouse; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will\\nhave been on a fool\\'s errand. Still, I should advise you by all means\\nto go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such\\ndistant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the\\nwinds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds\\ncannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast and terrible are\\nthe seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take\\nyour own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can\\nhave a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can\\nescort you to Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak\\nthe truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,\\n\"Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues\\nof the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings\\nto Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is\\nbed time. People should go away early and not keep late hours at a\\nreligious festival.\" \\n\\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants\\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the\\nmixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\\nevery man his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims\\ninto the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings. When they\\nhad made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded,\\nMinerva and Telemachus were forgoing on board their ship, but Nestor\\ncaught them up at once and stayed them. \\n\\n\"Heaven and the immortal gods,\" he exclaimed, \"forbid that you should\\nleave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor\\nand short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable\\nto find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me\\ntell you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit\\nthe son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship-\\nnot while I live- nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep\\nopen house as have done.\" \\n\\nThen Minerva answered, \"Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be\\nmuch better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore,\\nshall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back\\nto give orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only\\nolder person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus\\'\\nown age, who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return\\nto the ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the Cauconians\\nwhere I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus,\\nnow that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and\\nlet one of your sons go with him. Be pleased also to provide him with\\nyour best and fleetest horses.\" \\n\\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and\\nall marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus\\nby the hand. \"My friend,\" said he, \"I see that you are going to be\\na great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you\\nare still so young. This can have been none other of those who dwell\\nin heaven than Jove\\'s redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who showed\\nsuch favour towards your brave father among the Argives.\" \"Holy queen,\"\\nhe continued, \"vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my good\\nwife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a\\nbroad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought\\nby man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up\\nto you in sacrifice.\" \\n\\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way\\nto his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. When they\\nhad got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats,\\nhe mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when\\nthe housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed\\nthe wine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to Minerva, daughter\\nof Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink-offerings\\nand had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home\\nto bed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in\\nthe room that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was\\nthe only unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an\\ninner room of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.\\n\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Nestor\\nleft his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished\\nmarble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus,\\npeer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the\\nhouse of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand, as guardian\\nof the public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round\\nhim, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth\\nson was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him\\nsit with them. Nestor then addressed them. \\n\\n\"My sons,\" said he, \"make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first\\nand foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested\\nherself visibly to me during yesterday\\'s festivities. Go, then, one\\nor other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer,\\nand come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus\\'s\\nship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the\\nvessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to\\ngild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you\\nare; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and\\nto fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also-\\nto bring me some clear spring water.\" \\n\\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was\\nbrought in from the plain, and Telemachus\\'s crew came from the ship;\\nthe goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he\\nworked his gold, and Minerva herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor\\ngave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that\\nthe goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and\\nEchephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the\\nhouse in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other\\nhand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by\\nwith a sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a\\nbucket. Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the\\nbarley meal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a\\nlock from the heifer\\'s head upon the fire. \\n\\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal Thrasymedes\\ndealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut\\nthrough the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters\\nand daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she\\nwas eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they\\nlifted the heifer\\'s head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut\\nher throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut\\nher up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them\\nround in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the\\ntop of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine\\nover them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits\\nin their hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the\\ninward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces\\non the spits and toasted them over the fire. \\n\\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor\\'s youngest daughter, washed Telemachus.\\nWhen she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him\\na fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he came from\\nthe bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the outer meats\\nwere done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where\\nthey were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them\\nout their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had had enough\\nto eat and drink Nestor said, \"Sons, put Telemachus\\'s horses to the\\nchariot that he may start at once.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the\\nfleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision\\nof bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus\\ngot into the chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the reins and\\ntook his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew forward\\nnothing loth into the open country, leaving the high citadel of Pylos\\nbehind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon their\\nnecks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land. Then\\nthey reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus\\nand grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles entertained\\nthem hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared,\\nthey again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under\\nthe echoing gatehouse. Pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew\\nforward nothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands Of the\\nopen country, and in the course of time completed their journey, so\\nwell did their steeds take them. \\n\\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK IV\\n\\nThey reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon them where they drove\\nstraight to the of abode Menelaus [and found him in his own house,\\nfeasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son,\\nand also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that\\nvaliant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her\\nto him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing\\nthe marriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses\\nto the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles\\' son was reigning.\\nFor his only son he had found a bride from Sparta, daughter of Alector.\\nThis son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven\\nvouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who\\nwas fair as golden Venus herself. \\n\\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making\\nmerry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play\\nhis lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of\\nthem when the man struck up with his tune.] \\n\\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,\\nwhereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw\\nthem ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went\\nclose up to him and said, \"Menelaus, there are some strangers come\\nhere, two men, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall\\nwe take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as\\nthey best can?\" \\n\\nMenelaus was very angry and said, \"Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you\\nnever used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their\\nhorses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have\\nsupper; you and I have stayed often enough at other people\\'s houses\\nbefore we got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace\\nhenceforward.\" \\n\\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. They\\ntook their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to the\\nmangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they\\nleaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led\\nthe way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished\\nwhen they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon;\\nthen, when they had admired everything to their heart\\'s content, they\\nwent into the bath room and washed themselves. \\n\\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they\\nbrought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats\\nby the side of Menelaus. A maidservant brought them water in a beautiful\\ngolden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their\\nhands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought\\nthem bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in\\nthe house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats\\nand set cups of gold by their side. \\n\\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, \"Fall to, and welcome; when you\\nhave done supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such\\nmen as you cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line\\nof sceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as\\nyou are.\" \\n\\nOn this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set\\nnear him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good\\nthings that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat\\nand drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so\\nclose that no one might hear, \"Look, Pisistratus, man after my own\\nheart, see the gleam of bronze and gold- of amber, ivory, and silver.\\nEverything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian\\nJove. I am lost in admiration.\" \\n\\nMenelaus overheard him and said, \"No one, my sons, can hold his own\\nwith Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but\\namong mortal men- well, there may be another who has as much wealth\\nas I have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much\\nand have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before\\nI could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the\\nEgyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians,\\nand to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born,\\nand the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that country,\\nwhether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk,\\nfor the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling\\nand getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly\\nand shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, so\\nthat I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever\\nyour parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of\\nmy heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and magnificently\\nfurnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so that\\nI had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the\\nplain of Troy, far from Argos. I of grieve, as I sit here in my house,\\nfor one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently\\nI leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of\\nit. Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for one man more than for\\nthem all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and\\nsleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one of all the Achaeans\\nworked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing by it,\\nand has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a\\nlong time, and we know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father,\\nhis long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he\\nleft behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought\\nhim of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned,\\nso that he held his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaus\\nsaw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking,\\nor to ask him at once and find what it was all about. \\n\\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted\\nand perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought\\nher a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the\\nsilver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus\\nlived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world;\\nhe gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and\\nten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful\\npresents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work-box that ran\\non wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed\\nthis by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with\\nviolet coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took\\nher seat, put her feet upon the footstool, and began to question her\\nhusband. \\n\\n\"Do we know, Menelaus,\" said she, \"the names of these strangers who\\nhave come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?-but I cannot\\nhelp saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman\\nso like somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what\\nto think) as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left\\nas a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in\\nyour hearts, on account of my most shameless self.\" \\n\\n\"My dear wife,\" replied Menelaus, \"I see the likeness just as you\\ndo. His hands and feet are just like Ulysses\\'; so is his hair, with\\nthe shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when\\nI was talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on\\nmy account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.\"\\n\\nThen Pisistratus said, \"Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in\\nthinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest,\\nand is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one\\nwhose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father,\\nNestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether\\nyou could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble\\nat home when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters;\\nand this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent,\\nand there is no one among his own people to stand by him.\"\\n\\n\"Bless my heart,\" replied Menelaus, \"then I am receiving a visit from\\nthe son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake.\\nI had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when\\nheaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should\\nhave founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should\\nhave made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people,\\nand should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities\\nthat are subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually,\\nand nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an\\nintercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great\\ngood fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting\\nhome at all.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,\\nTelemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his\\neyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus\\nwhom the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\\n\\n\"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told\\nme you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then,\\nit be possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while\\nI am getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the\\nforenoon I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone.\\nThis is all we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads\\nfor them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who\\ndied at Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure\\nto have known him- his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon\\nhim myself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and\\nin fight valiant.\" \\n\\n\"Your discretion, my friend,\" answered Menelaus, \"is beyond your years.\\nIt is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man\\nis son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring-\\nand it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days, giving\\nhim a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who are\\nboth we disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all\\nthis weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be poured\\nover our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in\\nthe morning.\" \\n\\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands\\nand they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.\\n\\nThen Jove\\'s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged\\nthe wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour.\\nWhoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the\\nrest of the day, not even though his father and mother both of them\\ndrop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before\\nhis very eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had\\nbeen given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where\\nthere grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into the mixing-bowl\\nand others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is\\na skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen\\nhad put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve\\nthe wine round, she said: \\n\\n\"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable\\nmen (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and\\nevil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen\\nwhile I tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single\\none of the exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he\\nwas before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties.\\nHe covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in\\nrags, and entered the enemy\\'s city looking like a menial or a beggar.\\nand quite different from what he did when he was among his own people.\\nIn this disguise he entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything\\nto him. I alone recognized him and began to question him, but he was\\ntoo cunning for me. When, however, I had washed and anointed him and\\nhad given him clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not to\\nbetray him to the Trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp\\nand to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant to do. He\\nkilled many Trojans and got much information before he reached the\\nArgive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation,\\nbut for my own part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to oam\\nafter my home, and I was unhappy about wrong that Venus had done me\\nin taking me over there, away from my country, my girl, and my lawful\\nwedded husband, who is indeed by no means deficient either in person\\nor understanding.\" \\n\\nThen Menelaus said, \"All that you have been saying, my dear wife,\\nis true. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes,\\nbut I have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance\\ntoo, and what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein\\nall the bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and\\ndestruction upon the Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; some\\ngod who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and\\nyou had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding\\nplace and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and\\nmimicked all our wives -Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside\\nheard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds\\nwhether to spring out then and there, or to answer you from inside,\\nbut Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except\\nAnticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his\\ntwo brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this\\nthat saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away\\nagain.\" \\n\\n\"How sad,\" exclaimed Telemachus, \"that all this was of no avail to\\nsave him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to\\nsend us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon\\nof sleep.\" \\n\\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that\\nwas in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread\\ncoverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to\\nwear. So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds,\\nto which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then,\\ndid Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while\\nthe son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaus\\nrose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,\\ngirded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like\\nan immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:\\n\\n\"And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to\\nLacedaemon? Are you on public or private business? Tell me all about\\nit.\" \\n\\n\"I have come, sir replied Telemachus, \"to see if you can tell me anything\\nabout my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate\\nis being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing\\ngreat numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their\\naddresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your knees if\\nhaply you may tell me about my father\\'s melancholy end, whether you\\nsaw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller;\\nfor he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any\\npity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw.\\nIf my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word\\nor deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in\\nmind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.\" \\n\\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. \"So,\" he exclaimed,\\n\"these cowards would usurp a brave man\\'s bed? A hind might as well\\nlay her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed\\nin the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back\\nto his lair will make short work with the pair of them- and so will\\nUlysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if\\nUlysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides\\nin Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered\\nhim- if he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they\\nwould have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions,\\nhowever, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you\\nwithout concealment all that the old man of the sea told me.\\n\\n\"I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt,\\nfor my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods\\nare very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far\\nas a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there\\nis an island called Pharos- it has a good harbour from which vessels\\ncan get out into open sea when they have taken in water- and the gods\\nbecalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to\\nhelp me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my\\nmen would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and\\nsaved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man\\nof the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me. \\n\\n\"She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for\\nthe men used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in\\nthe hope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of\\nhunger. \\'Stranger,\\' said she, \\'it seems to me that you like starving\\nin this way- at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you\\nstick here day after day, without even trying to get away though your\\nmen are dying by inches.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Let me tell you,\\' said I, \\'whichever of the goddesses you may happen\\nto be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have\\noffended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the\\ngods know everything. which of the immortals it is that is hindering\\nme in this way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach\\nmy home.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Stranger,\\' replied she, \\'I will make it all quite clear to you.\\nThere is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose\\nname is Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father;\\nhe is Neptune\\'s head man and knows every inch of ground all over the\\nbottom of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will\\ntell you about your voyage, what courses you are to take, and how\\nyou are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also tell\\nyou, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house both\\ngood and bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerous\\njourney.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Can you show me,\\' said I, \\'some stratagem by means of which I may\\ncatch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For\\na god is not easily caught- not by a mortal man.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Stranger,\\' said she, \\'I will make it all quite clear to you. About\\nthe time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of\\nthe sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that\\nfurs the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down,\\nand goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals- Halosydne\\'s\\nchickens as they call them- come up also from the grey sea, and go\\nto sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and fish-like\\nsmell do they bring with them. Early to-morrow morning I will take\\nyou to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore,\\nthe three best men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all\\nthe tricks that the old man will play you. \\n\\n\"\\'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when\\nhe has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go\\nto sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you\\nsee that he is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold\\nhim fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He\\nwill turn himself into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth,\\nand will become also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast\\nand grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and\\ncomes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may\\nslacken your hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the\\ngods it is that is angry with you, and what you must do to reach your\\nhome over the seas.\\' \\n\\n\"Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to\\nthe place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart\\nwas clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got\\nsupper ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.\\n\\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I took the\\nthree men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went\\nalong by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess\\nfetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them\\njust skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father. Then\\nshe dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should\\ncome up. When we were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits\\none after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade\\nwould have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was\\nmost distressing- who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could\\nhelp it?-but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something\\nthat gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each man\\'s\\nnostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals.\\n\\n\"We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the\\nseals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon\\nthe old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat\\nseals he went over them and counted them. We were among the first\\nhe counted, and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down\\nto sleep as soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him\\nwith a shout and seized him; on which he began at once with his old\\ntricks, and changed himself first into a lion with a great mane; then\\nall of a sudden he became a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next\\nmoment he was running water, and then again directly he was a tree,\\nbut we stuck to him and never lost hold, till at last the cunning\\nold creature became distressed, and said, Which of the gods was it,\\nSon of Atreus, that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and\\nseizing me against my will? What do you want?\\' \\n\\n\"\\'You know that yourself, old man,\\' I answered, \\'you will gain nothing\\nby trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in\\nthis island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing\\nall heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the\\nimmortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail\\nthe sea so as to reach my home?\\' \\n\\n\"Then,\\' he said, \\'if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,\\nyou must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before\\nembarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your friends,\\nand to your own house, till you have returned to the heaven fed stream\\nof Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods that reign\\nin heaven. When you have done this they will let you finish your voyage.\\'\\n\\n\"I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long\\nand terrible voyage to Egypt; nevertheless, I answered, \\'I will do\\nall, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell\\nme true, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us\\nwhen we set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one\\nof them came to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his\\nfriends when the days of his fighting were done.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Son of Atreus,\\' he answered, \\'why ask me? You had better not know\\nwhat I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have\\nheard my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone,\\nbut many still remain, and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans\\nperished during their return home. As for what happened on the field\\nof battle- you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still\\nat sea, alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for\\nNeptune drove him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he\\nlet him get safe out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva\\'s hatred\\nhe would have escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting.\\nHe said the gods could not drown him even though they had tried to\\ndo so, and when Neptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident\\nin his two brawny hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces.\\nThe base remained where it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting\\nfell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt\\nwater and was drowned. \\n\\n\"\\'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but\\nwhen he was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was\\ncaught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against\\nhis will, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell,\\nbut where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed\\nas though he was to return safely after all, for the gods backed the\\nwind into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon\\nkissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in\\nhis own country. \\n\\n\"\\'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch,\\nand to whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had been\\nlooking out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give\\nhim the slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon\\ngo by, he went and told Aegisthus who at once began to lay a plot\\nfor him. He picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them\\nin ambuscade on one side the cloister, while on the opposite side\\nhe prepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon,\\nand invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there,\\nall unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him\\nwhen the banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the\\nshambles; not one of Agamemnon\\'s followers was left alive, nor yet\\none of Aegisthus\\', but they were all killed there in the cloisters.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat\\ndown upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear\\nto live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had\\nhad my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of\\nthe sea said, \\'Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying\\nso bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast\\nas ever you can, for Aegisthus be still alive, and even though Orestes\\nhas beforehand with you in kilting him, you may yet come in for his\\nfuneral.\\' \\n\\n\"On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, \\'I know,\\nthen, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of\\nwhom you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home?\\nor is he dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'The third man,\\' he answered, \\'is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I\\ncan see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph\\nCalypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home\\nfor he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your\\nown end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take\\nyou to the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There\\nfair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than\\nany where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain,\\nnor hail, nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that\\nsings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This will\\nhappen to you because you have married Helen, and are Jove\\'s son-in-law.\\'\\n\\n\"As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the\\nships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I\\nwent along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night\\nwas falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,\\nrosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and\\nput our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves,\\ntook our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars.\\nI again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and\\noffered hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased\\nheaven\\'s anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of Agamemnon that\\nhis name might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home,\\nfor the gods sent me a fair wind. \\n\\n\"And now for yourself- stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and\\nI will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present\\nof a chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice\\nthat so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a drink-offering\\nto the immortal gods.\" \\n\\n\"Son of Atreus,\" replied Telemachus, \"do not press me to stay longer;\\nI should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months;\\nI find your conversation so delightful that I should never once wish\\nmyself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos\\nare already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for\\nany present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should\\nhe a piece of plate. I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca,\\nbut will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have much flat\\nground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as also meadowsweet and\\nwheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas\\nin Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country\\nis more fit for goats than horses, and I like it the better for that.\\nNone of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and\\nIthaca least of all.\" \\n\\nMenelaus smiled and took Telemachus\\'s hand within his own. \"What you\\nsay,\" said he, \"shows that you come of good family. I both can, and\\nwill, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most\\nprecious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl by Vulcan\\'s\\nown hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold.\\nPhaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit\\nwhich I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey. I\\nwill make you a present of it.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king\\'s house.\\nThey brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for\\nthem to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in\\nthe courts]. \\n\\nMeanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at\\na mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses\\' house, and were\\nbehaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who\\nwere their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were\\nsitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to Antinous,\\n\\n\"Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?\\nHe has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis: I have\\ntwelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not\\nyet broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break\\nhim.\" \\n\\nThey were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that\\nTelemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was\\nonly away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with\\nthe swineherd; so Antinous said, \"When did he go? Tell me truly, and\\nwhat young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own\\nbondsmen- for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let\\nhim have the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did\\nhe take it without yourleave?\" \\n\\n\"I lent it him,\" answered Noemon, \"what else could I do when a man\\nof his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige\\nhim? I could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they\\nwere the best young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain-\\nor some god who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for\\nI saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting\\nout for Pylos.\" \\n\\nNoemon then went back to his father\\'s house, but Antinous and Eurymachus\\nwere very angry. They told the others to leave off playing, and to\\ncome and sit down along with themselves. When they came, Antinous\\nson of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with rage, and\\nhis eyes flashed fire as he said: \\n\\n\"Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter;\\nwe had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow\\nhas got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be\\ngiving us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown.\\nFind me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie\\nin wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then\\nrue the day that he set out to try and get news of his father.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then\\nall of them went inside the buildings. \\n\\nIt was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were plotting;\\nfor a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the outer court\\nas they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell his mistress.\\nAs he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said: \"Medon, what\\nhave the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the maids to leave\\ntheir master\\'s business and cook dinner for them? I wish they may\\nneither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else,\\nbut let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of\\nmy son\\'s estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children\\nhow good Ulysses had been to them- never doing anything high-handed,\\nnor speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and\\nthey may take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses\\nnever did an unjust thing by anybody- which shows what bad hearts\\nyou have, and that there is no such thing as gratitude left in this\\nworld.\" \\n\\nThen Medon said, \"I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are\\nplotting something much more dreadful now- may heaven frustrate their\\ndesign. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming\\nhome from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his\\nfather.\" \\n\\nThen Penelope\\'s heart sank within her, and for a long time she was\\nspeechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no utterance.\\nAt last, however, she said, \"Why did my son leave me? What business\\nhad he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the\\nocean like sea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one\\nbehind him to keep up his name?\" \\n\\n\"I do not know,\" answered Medon, \"whether some god set him on to it,\\nor whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out\\nif his father was dead, or alive and on his way home.\" \\n\\nThen he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.\\nThere were plenty of seats in the house, but she. had no heart for\\nsitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor\\nof her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both\\nold and young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last\\nin a transport of sorrow she exclaimed, \\n\\n\"My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction\\nthan any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave\\nand lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven,\\nand whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now\\nmy darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my\\nhaving heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was\\nnot one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my\\nbed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If\\nI had known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give\\nit up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse\\nbehind him- one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call old\\nDolius, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is my\\ngardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything to Laertes, who may\\nbe able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side,\\nas against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and that\\nof Ulysses.\" \\n\\nThen the dear old nurse Euryclea said, \"You may kill me, Madam, or\\nlet me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell\\nyou the real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he\\nwanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn\\noath that I would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days,\\nunless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did\\nnot want you to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash\\nyour face, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer\\nprayers to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save\\nhim even though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes:\\nhe has trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods\\nhate die race of the race of the son of Arceisius so much, but there\\nwill be a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house\\nand the fair fields that lie far all round it.\" \\n\\nWith these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried\\nthe tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress,\\nand went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley\\ninto a basket and began praying to Minerva. \\n\\n\"Hear me,\" she cried, \"Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable.\\nIf ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep\\nor heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling\\nson from the villainy of the suitors.\" \\n\\nShe cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer; meanwhile\\nthe suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister, and one\\nof them said: \\n\\n\"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.\\nLittle does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.\"\\n\\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what was going to happen.\\nThen Antinous said, \"Comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest\\nsome of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in silence,\\nabout which we are all of a mind.\" \\n\\nHe then chose twenty men, and they went down to their. ship and to\\nthe sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast\\nand sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted\\nthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft,\\nwhile their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made\\nthe ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers,\\nand waited till night should fall. \\n\\nBut Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink,\\nand wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered\\nby the wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen\\nhemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank\\ninto a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.\\n\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in\\nthe likeness of Penelope\\'s sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who\\nhad married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go\\nto the house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so\\nit came into her room by the hole through which the thong went for\\npulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying, \\n\\n\"You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer\\nyou to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he\\nwill yet come back to you.\" \\n\\nPenelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,\\n\"Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I\\nsuppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then,\\nto leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture\\nme? I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every\\ngood quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas\\nand middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of\\na ship- a foolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor\\nto going about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about\\nhim than about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him,\\nlest something should happen to him, either from the people among\\nwhom he has gone, or by sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting\\nagainst him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home.\"\\n\\nThen the vision said, \"Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There\\nis one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have\\nstand by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon\\nyou, and who has sent me to bear you this message.\" \\n\\n\"Then,\" said Penelope, \"if you are a god or have been sent here by\\ndivine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one- is he\\nstill alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?\"\\n\\nAnd the vision said, \"I shall not tell you for certain whether he\\nis alive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.\"\\n\\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated\\ninto thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted,\\nso vivid had been her dream. \\n\\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the\\nsea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called\\nAsteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos,\\nand there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie.\\nHere then the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK V\\n\\nAnd now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus- harbinger of\\nlight alike to mortals and immortals- the gods met in council and\\nwith them, Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva\\nbegan to tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied\\nhim away there in the house of the nymph Calypso. \\n\\n\"Father Jove,\" said she, \"and all you other gods that live in everlasting\\nbliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed\\nruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will\\nbe all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects\\nbut has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as though he were their\\nfather. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where dwells\\nthe nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get back\\nto his own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take\\nhim over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to murder\\nhis only son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon,\\nwhere he has been to see if he can get news of his father.\"\\n\\n\"What, my dear, are you talking about?\" replied her father, \"did you\\nnot send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses\\nto get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able\\nto protect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while the\\nsuitors have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, \"Mercury, you\\nare our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that\\npoor Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods\\nnor men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he\\nis to reach fertile Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, who are near\\nof kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he were one of ourselves.\\nThey will send him in a ship to his own country, and will give him\\nmore bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back from\\nTroy, if he had had had all his prize money and had got home without\\ndisaster. This is how we have settled that he shall return to his\\ncountry and his friends.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did\\nas he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals\\nwith which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the\\nwand with which he seals men\\'s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as\\nhe pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped\\ndown through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose\\nwaves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and\\ncorner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray.\\nHe flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to\\nthe island which was his journey\\'s end, he left the sea and went on\\nby land till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.\\n\\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth,\\nand one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and\\nsandal wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her\\ngolden shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her\\ncave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress\\ntrees, wherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests- owls,\\nhawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the\\nwaters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly\\nabout the mouth of the cave; there were also four running rills of\\nwater in channels cut pretty close together, and turned hither and\\nthither so as to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage\\nover which they flowed. Even a god could not help being charmed with\\nsuch a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when\\nhe had admired it sufficiently he went inside the cave. \\n\\nCalypso knew him at once- for the gods all know each other, no matter\\nhow far they live from one another- but Ulysses was not within; he\\nwas on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with\\ntears in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso\\ngave Mercury a seat and said: \"Why have you come to see me, Mercury-\\nhonoured, and ever welcome- for you do not visit me often? Say what\\nyou want; I will do it for be you at once if I can, and if it can\\nbe done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before\\nyou. \\n\\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and\\nmixed him some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had\\nenough, and then said: \\n\\n\"We are speaking god and goddess to one another, one another, and\\nyou ask me why I have come here, and I will tell you truly as you\\nwould have me do. Jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could\\npossibly want to come all this way over the sea where there are no\\ncities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs?\\nNevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross Jove,\\nnor transgress his orders. He says that you have here the most ill-starred\\nof alf those who fought nine years before the city of King Priam and\\nsailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On their way\\nhome they sinned against Minerva, who raised both wind and waves against\\nthem, so that all his brave companions perished, and he alone was\\ncarried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you are to let this\\nby man go at once, for it is decreed that he shall not perish here,\\nfar from his own people, but shall return to his house and country\\nand see his friends again.\" \\n\\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, \"You gods,\" she exclaimed,\\nto be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and hate seeing\\na goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open\\nmatrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious\\ngods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed him in Ortygia.\\nSo again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to him in\\na thrice ploughed fallow field, Jove came to hear of it before so\\nlong and killed Iasion with his thunder-bolts. And now you are angry\\nwith me too because I have a man here. I found the poor creature sitting\\nall alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with lightning\\nand sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while\\nhe himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond\\nof him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal,\\nso that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot cross\\nJove, nor bring his counsels to nothing; therefore, if he insists\\nupon it, let the man go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him\\nanywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men who can take him.\\nNevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good faith,\\nas will be likely to bring him safely to his own country.\"\\n\\n\"Then send him away,\" said Mercury, \"or Jove will be angry with you\\nand punish you\"\\' \\n\\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses,\\nfor she had heard Jove\\'s message. She found him sitting upon the beach\\nwith his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home-sickness;\\nfor he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep\\nwith her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have\\nit so. As for the day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea-shore,\\nweeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon\\nthe sea. Calypso then went close up to him said: \\n\\n\"My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your\\nlife out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will;\\nso go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with\\nan upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put\\nbread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. I will\\nalso give you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home,\\nif the gods in heaven so will it- for they know more about these things,\\nand can settle them better than I can.\" \\n\\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. \"Now goddess,\" he answered, \"there\\nis something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help\\nme home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on\\na raft. Not even a well-found ship with a fair wind could venture\\non such a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall mage\\nme go on board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean\\nme no mischief.\" \\n\\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: \"You know a\\ngreat deal,\" said she, \"but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above\\nand earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx-\\nand this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take- that\\nI mean you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly\\nwhat I should do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite\\nstraightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry\\nfor you.\" \\n\\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses\\nfollowed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on\\ntill they came to Calypso\\'s cave, where Ulysses took the seat that\\nMercury had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of the\\nfood that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar for\\nherself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were before\\nthem. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink, Calypso\\nspoke, saying: \\n\\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own\\nland at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how\\nmuch suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own\\ncountry, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and\\nlet me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see\\nthis wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after\\nday; yet I flatter myself that at am no whit less tall or well-looking\\nthan she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should\\ncompare in beauty with an immortal.\" \\n\\n\"Goddess,\" replied Ulysses, \"do not be angry with me about this. I\\nam quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so\\nbeautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal.\\nNevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing else. If\\nsome god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and make the\\nbest of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea already,\\nso let this go with the rest.\" \\n\\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired\\ninto the inner part of the cave and went to bed. \\n\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Ulysses put\\non his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light\\ngossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle\\nabout her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself\\nto think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a\\ngreat bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides,\\nand had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She\\nalso gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of\\nthe island where the largest trees grew- alder, poplar and pine, that\\nreached the sky- very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for\\nhim in the water. Then, when she had shown him where the best trees\\ngrew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished\\ndoing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring\\nthem by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back\\nwith some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers\\ntogether with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled\\nshipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he filed a deck on\\ntop of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast\\nwith a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all\\nround with wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then\\nhe threw on a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him some\\nlinen to make the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making\\nthem fast with braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers,\\nhe drew the raft down into the water. \\n\\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso\\nsent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean\\nclothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another\\nlarger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions,\\nand found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair\\nand warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it,\\nwhile he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder.\\nHe never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting\\nBootes, and on the Bear- which men also call the wain, and which turns\\nround and round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping\\ninto the stream of Oceanus- for Calypso had told him to keep this\\nto his left. Days seven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the\\neighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of\\nthe Phaeacian coast appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon.\\n\\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight\\nof Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could\\nsee him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged\\nhis head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so the gods have\\nbeen changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia,\\nand now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed\\nthat he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Still,\\nhe shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with it.\"\\n\\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred\\nit round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows\\ntill earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth\\nout of the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon\\nhim all at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses\\'\\nheart began to fail him. \"Alas,\" he said to himself in his dismay,\\n\"what ever will become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she\\nsaid I should have trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all\\ncoming true. How black is Jove making heaven with his clouds, and\\nwhat a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once. I am\\nnow safe to perish. Blest and thrice blest were those Danaans who\\nfell before Troy in the cause of the sons of Atreus. Would that had\\nbeen killed on the day when the Trojans were pressing me so sorely\\nabout the dead body of Achilles, for then I should have had due burial\\nand the Achaeans would have honoured my name; but now it seems that\\nI shall come to a most pitiable end.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the\\nraft reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He\\nlet go the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that\\nit broke the mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into\\nthe sea. For a long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he\\ncould do to rise to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had\\ngiven him weighed him down; but at last he got his head above water\\nand spat out the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams.\\nIn spite of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft,\\nbut swam as fast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed\\non board again so as to escape drowning. The sea took the raft and\\ntossed it about as Autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round\\nupon a road. It was as though the South, North, East, and West winds\\nwere all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it at once.\\n\\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called Leucothea,\\nsaw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been since raised\\nto the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great distress Ulysses\\nnow was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull\\nfrom the waves, took her seat upon the raft. \\n\\n\"My poor good man,\" said she, \"why is Neptune so furiously angry with\\nyou? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster\\nhe will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as\\nI bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind, and swim\\nto the Phaecian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take\\nmy veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can\\ncome to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land\\ntake it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then\\ngo away again.\" With these words she took off her veil and gave it\\nhim. Then she dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath\\nthe dark blue waters. \\n\\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. \"Alas,\" he said to himself\\nin his dismay, \"this is only some one or other of the gods who is\\nluring me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. At any rate\\nI will not do so at present, for the land where she said I should\\nbe quit of all troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know\\nwhat I will do- I am sure it will be best- no matter what happens\\nI will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but\\nwhen the sea breaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I\\ncan do any better than this.\" \\n\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave\\nthat seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over\\nthe raft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry\\nchaff tossed about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank\\nand rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off the\\nclothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino\\'s veil under his arms, and\\nplunged into the sea- meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched\\nhim as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying,\\n\"\\'There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall in with\\nwell-to-do people. I do not think you will be able to say that I have\\nlet you off too lightly.\" On this he lashed his horses and drove to\\nAegae where his palace is. \\n\\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all\\nthe winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused\\na good stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till\\nUlysses reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.\\n\\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water,\\nwith a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but\\nwhen the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm\\nwithout so much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell\\nhe looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children\\nrejoice when their dear father begins to get better after having for\\na long time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but\\nthe gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when he again\\nsaw land and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might\\nonce more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot,\\nhe began to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the\\nswell still broke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was\\nenveloped in spray; there were no harbours where a ship might ride,\\nnor shelter of any kind, but only headlands, low-lying rocks, and\\nmountain tops. \\n\\nUlysses\\' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to\\nhimself, \"Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that\\nI had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the\\ncoast is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer\\nfrom the sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot climb\\nout for want of foothold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me\\noff my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the water- which\\nwould give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further\\nin search of some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry\\nme out to sea again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some\\ngreat monster of the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many\\nsuch, and I know that Neptune is very angry with me.\" \\n\\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with\\nsuch force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn\\nto pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold\\nof the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till\\nthe wave retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave\\ncame on again and carried him back with it far into the sea-tearing\\nhis hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks\\nit from its bed, and the stones come up along with it even so did\\nthe rocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew\\nhim deep down under the water. \\n\\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his\\nown destiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about\\nhim. He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating\\nagainst the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the\\nshore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take\\nthe waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of\\na river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there were\\nno rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there\\nwas a current, so he prayed inwardly and said: \\n\\n\"Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of\\nthe sea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has\\nlost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore\\nin my distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees\\nof your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself\\nyour suppliant.\" \\n\\nThen the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm\\nbefore him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here\\nat last Ulysses\\' knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had\\ncompletely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and\\nnostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither\\nbreathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,\\nwhen he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off\\nthe scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt stream\\nof the river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave\\nthat bore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down\\namong the rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth. \\n\\n\"Alas,\" he cried to himself in his dismay, \"what ever will become\\nof me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed\\nthrough the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the\\nbitter cold and damp may make an end of me- for towards sunrise there\\nwill be a keen wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand,\\nI climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some\\nthicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night\\'s rest, but some\\nsavage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.\" \\n\\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one\\nupon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath\\ntwo shoots of olive that grew from a single stock- the one an ungrafted\\nsucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally,\\ncould break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun\\'s rays\\npierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow\\ninto one another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself\\na bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying\\nabout- enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard\\nwinter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself\\ndown and heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone\\nin the country, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed\\nin the ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere,\\neven so did Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed\\na sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose\\nall memories of his sorrows. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK VI\\n\\nSo here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went\\noff to the country and city of the Phaecians- a people who used to\\nlive in the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now\\nthe Cyclopes were stronger than they and plundered them, so their\\nking Nausithous moved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far\\nfrom all other people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses\\nand temples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead\\nand gone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels\\nwere inspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did\\nMinerva hie in furtherance of the return of Ulysses. \\n\\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there\\nslept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to\\nKing Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very\\npretty, one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well-made\\nfolding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas\\'s\\ndaughter, who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age;\\nthen, coming up to the girl\\'s bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered\\nover her head and said: \\n\\n\"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy\\ndaughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are\\ngoing to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well\\ndressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend\\nyou. This is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your\\nfather and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow\\na washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you so\\nthat you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the\\nbest young men among your own people are courting you, and you are\\nnot going to remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore,\\nto have a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs,\\nrobes, and girdles; and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter\\nfor you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the\\ntown.\" \\n\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say\\nis the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and\\nneither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine\\nand in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are\\nillumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which the goddess\\nwent when she had given instructions to the girl. \\n\\nBy and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about\\nher dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell\\nher father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room.\\nHer mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with\\nher maids around her, and she happened to catch her father just as\\nhe was going out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the\\nPhaeacian aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:\\n\\n\"Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want\\nto take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are\\nthe chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a clean\\nshirt when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have\\nfive sons at home, two of them married, while the other three are\\ngood-looking bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen\\nwhen they go to a dance, and I have been thinking about all this.\"\\n\\nShe did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like\\nto, but her father knew and said, \"You shall have the mules, my love,\\nand whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men\\nshall get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold\\nall your clothes.\" \\n\\nOn this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out,\\nharnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes\\ndown from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her mother\\nprepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things,\\nand a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon, and\\nher mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women\\nmight anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and reins and lashed\\nthe mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the\\nroad. They pulled without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa\\nand her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were with her.\\n\\nWhen they reached the water side they went to the washing-cisterns,\\nthrough which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any\\nquantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the\\nmules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that\\ngrew by the water side. They took the clothes out of the waggon, put\\nthem in the water, and vied with one another in treading them in the\\npits to get the dirt out. After they had washed them and got them\\nquite clean, they laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had\\nraised a high beach of shingle, and set about washing themselves and\\nanointing themselves with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by\\nthe side of the stream, and waited for the sun to finish drying the\\nclothes. When they had done dinner they threw off the veils that covered\\ntheir heads and began to play at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them.\\nAs the huntress Diana goes forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or\\nErymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer, and the wood-nymphs, daughters\\nof Aegis-bearing Jove, take their sport along with her (then is Leto\\nproud at seeing her daughter stand a full head taller than the others,\\nand eclipse the loveliest amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so\\ndid the girl outshine her handmaids. \\n\\nWhen it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the\\nclothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider\\nhow Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct\\nhim to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball\\nat one of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On\\nthis they all shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat\\nup in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself, \"what kind of people have I come amongst?\\nAre they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or hospitable and humane?\\nI seem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those\\nof the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows\\nof green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let\\nme try if I cannot manage to get a look at them.\" \\n\\nAs he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough\\ncovered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some\\nlion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength\\nand defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest\\nof oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even\\ninto a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep- even such\\ndid Ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked\\nas he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and\\nso begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off along the spits\\nthat jutted out into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm,\\nfor Minerva put courage into her heart and took away all fear from\\nher. She stood right in front of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he\\nshould go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees\\nas a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her to give him some\\nclothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he deemed it\\nbest to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offence\\nat his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her\\nin honeyed and persuasive language. \\n\\n\"O queen,\" he said, \"I implore your aid- but tell me, are you a goddess\\nor are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven,\\nI can only conjecture that you are Jove\\'s daughter Diana, for your\\nface and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are\\na mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and mother-\\nthrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted\\nthey must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself going out\\nto a dance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts\\nhave been the richest, and who takes you to his own home. I never\\nyet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost in\\nadmiration as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young palm\\ntree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of Apollo-\\nfor I was there, too, with much people after me, when I was on that\\njourney which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet did\\nsuch a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I admired\\nand wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at yourself.\\nI dare not clasp your knees, but I am in great distress; yesterday\\nmade the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the sea.\\nThe winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian island,\\nand now fate has flung me upon this coast that I may endure still\\nfurther suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to the\\nend of it, but rather that heaven has still much evil in store for\\nme. \\n\\n\"And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person\\nI have met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way\\nto your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither\\nto wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart\\'s\\ndesire- husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing\\nbetter in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind\\nin a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their\\nfriends glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.\"\\n\\nTo this Nausicaa answered, \"Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives\\nprosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what\\nhe has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now, however,\\nthat you have come to this our country, you shall not want for clothes\\nnor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably\\nlook for. I will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the\\nname of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to\\nAlcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested.\"\\n\\nThen she called her maids and said, \"Stay where you are, you girls.\\nCan you not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him\\nfor a robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here\\nto do us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live\\napart on a land\\'s end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing\\nto do with any other people. This is only some poor man who has lost\\nhis way, and we must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners\\nin distress are under Jove\\'s protection, and will take what they can\\nget and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to\\neat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered\\nfrom the wind.\" \\n\\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one another\\nback. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told\\nthem, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the\\nlittle golden cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in the stream.\\nBut Ulysses said, \"Young women, please to stand a little on one side\\nthat I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with\\noil, for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon\\nit. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed\\nto strip before a number of good-looking young women.\" \\n\\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses\\nwashed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back\\nand from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself,\\nand had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil,\\nand put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then\\nmade him look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair\\ngrow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth\\nblossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful\\nworkman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva\\nenriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it- and his work is full\\nof beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach,\\nlooking quite young and handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration;\\nthen she said to her maids: \\n\\n\"Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who\\nlive in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first\\nsaw him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of\\nthe gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be\\njust such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want\\nto go away. However, give him something to eat and drink.\"\\n\\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and\\ndrank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.\\nMeanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen\\nfolded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as\\nshe took her seat, she called Ulysses: \\n\\n\"Stranger,\" said she, \"rise and let us be going back to the town;\\nI will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I\\ncan tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaecians.\\nBut be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible person.\\nAs long as we are going past the fields- and farm lands, follow briskly\\nbehind the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself.\\nPresently, however, we shall come to the town, where you will find\\na high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on either side\\nwith a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn\\nup by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship\\ncan lie. You will see the market place with a temple of Neptune in\\nthe middle of it, and paved with large stones bedded in the earth.\\nHere people deal in ship\\'s gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails,\\nand here, too, are the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians\\nare not a nation of archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows,\\nbut are a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars,\\nand ships, with which they travel far over the sea. \\n\\n\"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against\\nme later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low\\nfellow, if he met us, might say, \\'Who is this fine-looking stranger\\nthat is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she End him? I suppose\\nshe is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she\\nhas taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or\\nsome god has at last come down from heaven in answer to her prayers,\\nand she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It would\\nbe a good thing if she would take herself of I for sh and find a husband\\nsomewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent\\nyoung Phaeacians who are in with her.\\' This is the kind of disparaging\\nremark that would be made about me, and I could not complain, for\\nI should myself be scandalized at seeing any other girl do the like,\\nand go about with men in spite of everybody, while her father and\\nmother were still alive, and without having been married in the face\\nof all the world. \\n\\n\"If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help\\nyou home, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars\\nby the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow\\nall round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about\\nas far from the town as a man\\' voice will carry. Sit down there and\\nwait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach\\nmy father\\'s house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come\\ninto the town and ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous.\\nYou will have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it\\nout to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything like such\\na fine house as he has. When you have got past the gates and through\\nthe outer court, go right across the inner court till you come to\\nmy mother. You will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her\\npurple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leans\\nback against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind\\nher. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on which he sits\\nand topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my mother,\\nand lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If\\nyou can gain her over, you may hope to see your own country again,\\nno matter how distant it may be.\" \\n\\nSo saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.\\nThe mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.\\nShe was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were\\nfollowing on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with\\njudgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove\\nof Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter\\nof Jove. \\n\\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable,\\nhear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking\\nme. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends\\nand be hospitably received by the Phaecians.\" \\n\\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not\\nshow herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune,\\nwho was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting\\nhome. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK VII\\n\\nThus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the\\ntown. When she reached her father\\'s house she drew up at the gateway,\\nand her brothers- comely as the gods- gathered round her, took the\\nmules out of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while\\nshe went to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira,\\nlit the fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from\\nApeira, and had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was\\nking over the Phaecians, and the people obeyed him as though he were\\na god. She had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for\\nher, and brought her supper for her into her own room. \\n\\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed\\na thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaecians\\nwho met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as\\nhe was just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness\\nof a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of him,\\nand Ulysses said: \\n\\n\"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?\\nI am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in\\nyour town and country.\" \\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house\\nyou want, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will\\ngo before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and\\ndo not look at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here\\ncannot abide strangers, and do not like men who come from some other\\nplace. They are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace\\nof Neptune in ships that glide along like thought, or as a bird in\\nthe air.\" \\n\\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not\\none of the Phaecians could see him as he passed through the city in\\nthe midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will\\ntowards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired\\ntheir harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of\\nthe city, which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking,\\nand when they reached the king\\'s house Minerva said: \\n\\n\"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show\\nyou. You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but\\ndo not be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more\\nlikely he is to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First\\nfind the queen. Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family\\nas her husband Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune,\\nwho was father to Nausithous by Periboea, a woman of great beauty.\\nPeriboea was the youngest daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned\\nover the giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own\\nlife to boot. \\n\\n\"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him,\\nthe great Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaecians. Nausithous had\\ntwo sons Rhexenor and Alcinous; Apollo killed the first of them while\\nhe was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter\\nArete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other woman is honoured\\nof all those that keep house along with their husbands. \\n\\n\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon\\nher as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city,\\nfor she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when\\nany women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to\\nsettle their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have\\nevery hope of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to\\nyour home and country.\" \\n\\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to\\nMarathon and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered\\nthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,\\nand he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold\\nof bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun\\nor moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end,\\nand the cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung\\non pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel\\nwas silver and the hook of the door was of gold. \\n\\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan,\\nwith his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over\\nthe palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never\\ngrow old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from\\none end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the\\nwomen of the house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaecians\\nused to sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons;\\nand there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in\\ntheir hands, raised on pedestals, to give light by night to those\\nwho were at table. There are fifty maid servants in the house, some\\nof whom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others\\nwork at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwards\\nand forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen\\nis so closely woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaecians are the\\nbest sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving,\\nfor Minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are\\nvery intelligent. \\n\\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about\\nfour acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful trees-\\npears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are luscious\\nfigs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail\\nall the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft\\nthat a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on pear,\\napple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there\\nis an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the\\ngrapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further\\non have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others\\nagain are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground\\nthere are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all\\nthe year round. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts\\nthroughout the whole garden, while the other is carried under the\\nground of the outer court to the house itself, and the town\\'s people\\ndraw water from it. Such, then, were the splendours with which the\\ngods had endowed the house of king Alcinous. \\n\\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he\\nhad looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\\nprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among\\nthe Phaecians making their drink-offerings to Mercury, which they\\nalways did the last thing before going away for the night. He went\\nstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness\\nin which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\\nAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and\\nat that moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\\nvisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition. \\n\\n\"Queen Arete,\" he exclaimed, \"daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress\\nI humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom\\nmay heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave\\ntheir possessions to their children, and all the honours conferred\\nupon them by the state) to help me home to my own country as soon\\nas possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\"\\n\\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their\\npeace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent\\nspeaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\\naddressed them thus: \\n\\n\"Alcinous,\" said he, \"it is not creditable to you that a stranger\\nshould be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is\\nwaiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise\\nand take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants\\nmix some wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to Jove\\nthe lord of thunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under\\nhis protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever\\nthere may be in the house.\" \\n\\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from\\nthe hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting\\nbeside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought\\nhim water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin\\nfor him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him;\\nan upper servant brought him bread and offered him many good things\\nof what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous\\nsaid to one of the servants, \"Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand\\nit round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder,\\nwho is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants.\" \\n\\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving\\nevery man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings,\\nand had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\\n\\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\\nhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\\nbanquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of\\nhis escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing\\nto his own country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no\\nmatter how distant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm\\nwhile on his homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will\\nhave to take the luck he was born with for better or worse like other\\npeople. It is possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals\\nwho has come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods\\nare departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made\\nthemselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them hecatombs.\\nThey come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves, and if\\nany solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other of\\nthem, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the\\ngods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\" \\n\\nThen Ulysses said: \"Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\\nnor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.\\nIndeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon\\nme, you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\\nlet me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very importunate\\nthing, and thrusts itself on a man\\'s notice no matter how dire is\\nhis distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall eat\\nand drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only\\non the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\\nand at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content\\nto die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and\\nall the greatness of my house.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that\\nhe should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then\\nwhen they had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much\\nas he was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode,\\nleaving Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the\\nservants were taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first\\nto speak, for she recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that\\nUlysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she\\nsaid, \"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should\\nlike to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes?\\nDid you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\" \\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate\\nin full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been\\nlaid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island\\nfar away in the sea which is called \\'the Ogygian.\\' Here dwells the\\ncunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives\\nby herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however,\\nme to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with\\nhis thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades\\nwere drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried\\nhither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during\\nthe darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian\\nisland where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated\\nme with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal\\nthat I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let\\nher do so. \\n\\n\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the\\ngood clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but\\nat last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her\\nown free will, either because Jove had told her she must, or because\\nshe had changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which\\nshe provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave\\nme good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and\\nfair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth\\nI caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast-\\nand glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was\\nstill much trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would\\nlet me go no further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea\\nwas so terribly high that I could no longer keep to my raft, which\\nwent to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I had to swim for it,\\ntill wind and current brought me to your shores. \\n\\n\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and\\nthe waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea\\nand swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing\\nplace, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind.\\nHere, then, I got out of the water and gathered my senses together\\nagain. Night was coming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket,\\nwhere I covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven\\nsent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept\\namong the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon,\\nwhen I woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter\\'s maid\\nservants playing upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking\\nlike a goddess. I besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent\\ndisposition, much more so than could be expected from so young a person-\\nfor young people are apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of\\nbread and wine, and when she had had me washed in the river she also\\ngave me the clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it\\nhas pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth.\"\\n\\nThen Alcinous said, \"Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not\\nto bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that\\nshe was the first person whose aid you asked.\" \\n\\n\"Pray do not scold her,\" replied Ulysses; \"she is not to blame. She\\ndid tell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and\\nafraid, for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me.\\nEvery human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.\"\\n\\n\"Stranger,\" replied Alcinous, \"I am not the kind of man to get angry\\nabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father\\nJove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you\\nare, and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry\\nmy daughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give\\nyou a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you\\nhere against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will\\nattend to-morrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep during\\nthe whole voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth\\nwaters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though\\nit be a long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people\\nwho saw it when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus\\nthe son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place- and yet they\\ndid the whole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves,\\nand came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships\\nexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.\"\\n\\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, \"Father Jove, grant\\nthat Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable\\nname among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in\\nthe room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs,\\nand to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for\\nUlysses to wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their\\nhands, and when they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and\\nsaid, \"Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\"\\nand glad indeed was he to go to his rest. \\n\\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;\\nbut Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his\\nwife by his side. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK VIII\\n\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous\\nand Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaecian place\\nof assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat\\ndown side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took\\nthe form of one of Alcinous\\' servants, and went round the town in\\norder to help Ulysses to get home. She went up to the citizens, man\\nby man, and said, \"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,\\ncome to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has\\njust come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks\\nlike an immortal god.\" \\n\\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked\\nto the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every\\none was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified\\nhim about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter\\nthan he really was, that he might impress the Phaecians favourably\\nas being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many\\ntrials of skill to which they would challenge him. Then, when they\\nwere got together, Alcinous spoke: \\n\\n\"Hear me,\" said he, \"aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,\\nthat I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may\\nbe, has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East\\nor West. He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled.\\nLet us then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before\\nhim; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to\\ncomplain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw\\na ship into the sea- one that has never yet made a voyage- and man\\nher with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you\\nhave made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and\\ncome to my house to prepare a feast. I will find you in everything.\\nI am giving will these instructions to the young men who will form\\nthe crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will\\njoin me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no\\nexcuses, and we will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no\\nbard like him whatever he may choose to sing about.\" \\n\\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a\\nservant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went\\nto the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they\\ndrew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound\\nthe oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in\\ndue course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel\\na little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the\\nhouse of King Alcinous. The outhouses, yards, and all the precincts\\nwere filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young;\\nand Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and\\ntwo oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent\\nbanquet. \\n\\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse\\nhad dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for\\nthough she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed\\nhim of his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests,\\nleaning it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on\\na peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with\\nhis hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his\\nside, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was\\nso disposed. \\n\\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before\\nthem, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse\\ninspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially\\na matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel\\nbetween Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped\\non one another as they gat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was\\nglad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for\\nApollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor\\nto consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by\\nthe will of Jove fell both Danaans and Trojans. \\n\\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head\\nand covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see\\nthat he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears\\nfrom his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering\\nto the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further,\\nfor they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle\\nover his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except\\nAlcinous, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that\\nhe was heaving. So he at once said, \"Aldermen and town councillors\\nof the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast, and\\nof the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore\\nto the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be\\nable to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as\\nboxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners.\" \\n\\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A\\nservant hung Demodocus\\'s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the\\ncloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the\\nchief men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd\\nof several thousands of people followed them, and there were many\\nexcellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus,\\nNauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus,\\nand Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus\\nson of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking\\nman among the Phaecians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\\nHalios, and Clytoneus, competed also. \\n\\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the\\nstarting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew\\nforward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way;\\nhe left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that\\na couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. They then turned to\\nthe painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best\\nman. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing\\nthe disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous\\'s\\nson Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said,\\nwhen they had all been diverted with the games, \"Let us ask the stranger\\nwhether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully\\nbuilt; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength,\\nnor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is\\nnothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no matter how strong\\nhe is.\" \\n\\n\"You are quite right, Laodamas,\" replied Euryalus, \"go up to your\\nguest and speak to him about it yourself.\" \\n\\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd\\nand said to Ulysses, \"I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for\\nsome one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of\\nthem- and you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is\\nnothing that does any one so much credit all his life long as the\\nshowing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore\\nat something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your return home\\nwill not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water,\\nand the crew is found.\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind\\nis set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite\\ntrouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king\\nand people to further me on my return home.\" \\n\\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, \"I gather, then, that\\nyou are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight\\nin. I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about\\nin ships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of\\ntheir outward freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to\\nbe much of the athlete about you.\" \\n\\n\"For shame, Sir,\" answered Ulysses, fiercely, \"you are an insolent\\nfellow- so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in\\nspeech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence,\\nbut heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he\\ncharms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his\\nhearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows,\\nand wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome\\nas a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion. This\\nis your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than you are,\\nbut you are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly\\nangry, and you are quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic\\nexercises; indeed, so long as I had youth and strength, I was among\\nthe first athletes of the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labour\\nand sorrow, for I have gone through much both on the field of battle\\nand by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will\\ncompete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick.\" \\n\\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,\\nlarger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians\\nwhen disc-throwing among themselves. Then, swinging it back, he threw\\nit from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as\\nhe did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight\\nas it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that\\nhad been made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked\\nthe place where it had fallen. \"A blind man, Sir,\" said she, \"could\\neasily tell your mark by groping for it- it is so far ahead of any\\nother. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian\\ncan come near to such a throw as yours.\" \\n\\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,\\nso he began to speak more pleasantly. \"Young men,\" said he, \"come\\nup to that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy\\nor even heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come\\non, for I am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do\\nnot care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but\\nnot with him because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one\\'s\\nown personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible\\nthing for a guest to challenge his host\\'s family at any game, especially\\nwhen he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under\\nhis own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards any one\\nelse, for I want to have the matter out and know which is the best\\nman. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport known among\\nmankind. I am an excellent archer. In battle I am always the first\\nto bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more are taking\\naim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man who could\\nshoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy and in\\npractice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those\\nwho still eat bread upon the face of the earth, but I should not like\\nto shoot against the mighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus the\\nCechalian-men who could shoot against the gods themselves. This in\\nfact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his end, for Apollo was angry\\nwith him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. I\\ncan throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow. Running\\nis the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the Phaecians\\nmight beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my provisions\\nran short, and therefore I am still weak.\" \\n\\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, \"Sir, we\\nhave had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from\\nwhich I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having\\nbeen displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to\\nyou by one of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered\\nby any one who knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend\\nmy meaning, and will explain to any be one of your chief men who may\\nbe dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we\\nhave an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are\\nnot particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers,\\nbut we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We\\nare extremely fond of good dinners, music, and dancing; we also like\\nfrequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds, so now, please,\\nsome of you who are the best dancers set about dancing, that our guest\\non his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass\\nall other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, minstrels. Demodocus\\nhas left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of you and\\nfetch it for him.\" \\n\\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king\\'s house,\\nand the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It\\nwas their business to manage everything connected with the sports,\\nso they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.\\nPresently the servant came back with Demodocus\\'s lyre, and he took\\nhis place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in\\nthe town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted\\nwith the merry twinkling of their feet. \\n\\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and\\nhow they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made\\nVenus many presents, and defiled King Vulcan\\'s marriage bed, so the\\nsun, who saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry\\nwhen he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding\\nmischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some\\nchains which none could either unloose or break, so that they might\\nstay there in that place. When he had finished his snare he went into\\nhis bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like\\ncobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling.\\nNot even a god could see them, so fine and subtle were they. As soon\\nas he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he\\nwere setting out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all places\\nin the world was the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind\\nlook out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his house,\\nburning with love for Venus. \\n\\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was\\nabout sitting down when Mars came inside the house, an said as he\\ntook her hand in his own, \"Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is\\nnot at home, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech\\nis barbarous.\" \\n\\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest,\\nwhereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread\\nfor them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found\\ntoo late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for\\nhe had turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun\\ntold him what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood\\nin the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the\\ngods. \\n\\n\"Father Jove,\" he cried, \"and all you other blessed gods who live\\nfor ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that\\nI will show you. Jove\\'s daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because\\nI am lame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and clean built,\\nwhereas I am a cripple- but my parents are to blame for that, not\\nI; they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together\\nasleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very\\nfond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there longer\\nthan they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there,\\nhowever, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave\\nhim for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.\"\\n\\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling\\nNeptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but\\nthe goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. Then the givers\\nof all good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared\\nwith inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had\\nbeen, whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:\\n\\n\"Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how\\nlimping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest\\ngod in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, \"Messenger\\nMercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains\\nwere, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?\" \\n\\n\"King Apollo,\" answered Mercury, \"I only wish I might get the chance,\\nthough there were three times as many chains- and you might look on,\\nall of you, gods and goddesses, but would sleep with her if I could.\"\\n\\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune\\ntook it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free\\nagain. \"Let him go,\" he cried, \"and I will undertake, as you require,\\nthat he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among\\nthe immortal gods.\" \\n\\n\"Do not,\" replied Vulcan, \"ask me to do this; a bad man\\'s bond is\\nbad security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should\\ngo away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?\"\\n\\n\"Vulcan,\" said Neptune, \"if Mars goes away without paying his damages,\\nI will pay you myself.\" So Vulcan answered, \"In this case I cannot\\nand must not refuse you.\" \\n\\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were\\nfree they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus\\nto Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant\\nwith burnt offerings. Here the Graces hathed her, and anointed her\\nwith oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they\\nclothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty. \\n\\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians\\nwere charmed as they heard him. \\n\\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was\\nno one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus\\nhad made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw\\nit up towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground\\nand caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had done\\nthrowing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance, and\\nat the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one\\nanother, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a\\ngreat stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said: \\n\\n\"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in\\nthe world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was\\nastonished as I saw them.\" \\n\\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaecians \"Aldermen\\nand town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of singular judgement;\\nlet us give him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably\\nexpect. There are twelve chief men among you, and counting myself\\nthere are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean cloak, a shirt,\\nand a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in a lump down\\nat once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a light\\nheart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\\npresent too, for he has been rude.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and\\nsent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, \"King\\nAlcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require.\\nHe shall have sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is\\nof silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into\\nwhich it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said,\\n\"Good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss\\nmay the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe\\nreturn, for I understand you have been long away from home, and have\\ngone through much hardship.\" \\n\\nTo which Ulysses answered, \"Good luck to you too my friend, and may\\nthe gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword\\nyou have given me along with your apology.\" \\n\\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards\\nsundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants\\nof the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here\\nhis sons received them, and placed them under their mother\\'s charge.\\nThen Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their\\nseats. \\n\\n\"Wife,\" said he, turning to Queen Arete, \"Go, fetch the best chest\\nwe have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper\\non the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath;\\nsee also to the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians\\nhave made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing\\nthat will follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet- which\\nis of exquisite workmanship- that he may be reminded of me for the\\nrest of his life whenever he makes a drink-offering to Jove, or to\\nany of the gods.\" \\n\\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast\\nas they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to\\na clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water\\nbecame hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. Meanwhile\\nArete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside it she\\npacked all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians\\nhad brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alcinous,\\nand said to Ulysses: \\n\\n\"See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once,\\nfor fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in\\nyour ship.\" \\n\\nWhen Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast\\nwith a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper\\nservant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very\\nglad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since\\nhe left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her\\nhad taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the\\nservants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given\\nhim a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the\\nguests who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by\\none of the bearing-posts supporting the roof if the cloister, and\\nadmired him as she saw him pass. \"Farewell stranger,\" said she, \"do\\nnot forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me first\\nthat you owe a ransom for having saved your life.\" \\n\\nAnd Ulysses said, \"Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove\\nthe mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall\\nI bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved\\nme.\" \\n\\nWhen he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was\\nthen served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in\\nthe favourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company,\\nnear one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might\\nlean against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty\\nof fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant,\\n\"Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it;\\nfor all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the\\nless; bards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the\\nmuse teaches them their songs and loves them.\" \\n\\nThe servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who\\ntook it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the\\ngood things that were before them, and as soon as they had had to\\neat and drink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, \"Demodocus, there is no\\none in the world whom I admire more than I do you. You must have studied\\nunder the Muse, Jove\\'s daughter, and under Apollo, so accurately do\\nyou sing the return of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and\\nadventures. If you were not there yourself, you must have heard it\\nall from some one who was. Now, however, change your song and tell\\nus of the wooden horse which Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva,\\nand which Ulysses got by stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting\\nit with the men who afterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this\\ntale aright I will tell all the world how magnificently heaven has\\nendowed you.\" \\n\\nThe bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some\\nof the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others,\\nhidden within the horse, were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan place\\nof assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their\\nfortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and\\nwere in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for breaking\\nit up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the\\nrock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice;\\nwhile yet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation\\nfor the gods. And this was how they settled it in the end, for the\\ncity was doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all\\nthe bravest of the Argives waiting to bring death and destruction\\non the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans issued from\\nthe horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their ambuscade.\\nHe sang how they over ran the city hither and thither and ravaged\\nit, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus to the\\nhouse of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most furiously,\\nnevertheless by Minerva\\'s help he was victorious. \\n\\nAll this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his\\ncheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws\\nherself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city\\nand people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children.\\nShe screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping\\nfor breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the\\nback and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labour\\nand sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks- even so piteously\\ndid Ulysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except\\nAlcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs\\nthat he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:\\n\\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease\\nhis song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it.\\nFrom the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing,\\nour guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently\\nin great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy\\nourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should\\nbe, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that\\nwe are making with so much good will, are wholly in his honour, and\\nany one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he\\nought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.\\n\\n\"Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor\\nreserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more\\npolite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which\\nyour father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which\\nyou were known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is\\nno one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name\\nwhatever, for people\\'s fathers and mothers give them names as soon\\nas they are born. Tell me also your country, nation, and city, that\\nour ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there.\\nFor the Phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as\\nthose of other nations have, but the ships themselves understand what\\nit is that we are thinking about and want; they know all the cities\\nand countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea just as\\nwell even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that there is\\nno danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do remember\\nhearing my father say that Neptune was angry with us for being too\\neasy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. He said that one\\nof these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from\\nhaving escorted some one, and bury our city under a high mountain.\\nThis is what my used to say, but whether the god will carry out his\\nthreat or no is a matter which he will decide for himself.\\n\\n\"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering,\\nand in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples themselves,\\nand of their cities- who were hostile, savage and uncivilized, and\\nwho, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us also why you\\nare made unhappy on hearing about the return of the Argive Danaans\\nfrom Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes\\nin order that future generations might have something to sing about.\\nDid you lose some brave kinsman of your wife\\'s when you were before\\nTroy? a son-in-law or father-in-law- which are the nearest relations\\na man has outside his own flesh and blood? or was it some brave and\\nkindly-natured comrade- for a good friend is as dear to a man as his\\nown brother?\" \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK IX\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear\\na bard with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing\\nbetter or more delightful than when a whole people make merry together,\\nwith the guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded\\nwith bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his\\ncup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see.\\nNow, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows,\\nand rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know\\nhow to begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the\\nhand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. \\n\\n\"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it,\\nand one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my there\\nguests though I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son\\nof Laertes, reknowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, so\\nthat my fame ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a\\nhigh mountain called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from\\nit there is a group of islands very near to one another- Dulichium,\\nSame, and the wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon,\\nall highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie\\naway from it towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave\\nmen, and my eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The\\ngoddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me to marry\\nher, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could\\nneither of them persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man\\nthan his own country and his parents, and however splendid a home\\nhe may have in a foreign country, if it be far from father or mother,\\nhe does not care about it. Now, however, I will tell you of the many\\nhazardous adventures which by Jove\\'s will I met with on my return\\nfrom Troy. \\n\\n\"When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which\\nis the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people\\nto the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided\\nequitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain.\\nI then said that we had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly\\nwould not obey me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing\\ngreat numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Cicons\\ncried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were more\\nin number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of\\nwar, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the\\noccasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as\\nleaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us,\\nso that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the\\nships, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another.\\nSo long as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held our own\\nagainst them, though they were more in number than we; but as the\\nsun went down, towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Cicons\\ngot the better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship\\nwe had; so we got away with those that were left. \\n\\n\"Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have\\nescaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till\\nwe had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished\\nby the hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against\\nus till it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick\\nclouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships\\nrun before the gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters,\\nso we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest\\ntowards the land. There we lay two days and two nights suffering much\\nalike from toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the third\\nday we again raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting\\nthe wind and steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at\\nthat time unharmed had not the North wind and the currents been against\\nme as I was doubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by\\nthe island of Cythera. \\n\\n\"I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the\\nsea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eater,\\nwho live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed\\nto take in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the\\nshore near the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of\\nmy company to see what manner of men the people of the place might\\nbe, and they had a third man under them. They started at once, and\\nwent about among the Lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave\\nthem to eat of the lotus, which was so delicious that those who ate\\nof it left off caring about home, and did not even want to go back\\nand say what had happened to them, but were for staying and munching\\nlotus with the Lotus-eater without thinking further of their return;\\nnevertheless, though they wept bitterly I forced them back to the\\nships and made them fast under the benches. Then I told the rest to\\ngo on board at once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and\\nleave off wanting to get home, so they took their places and smote\\nthe grey sea with their oars. \\n\\n\"We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land\\nof the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant\\nnor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley,\\nand grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild\\ngrapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They\\nhave no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the\\ntops of high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and\\nthey take no account of their neighbours. \\n\\n\"Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not\\nquite close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is\\noverrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are\\nnever disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen- who as a rule will\\nsuffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices- do\\nnot go there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it\\nlies a wilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no\\nliving thing upon it but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships,\\nnor yet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot therefore\\ngo from city to city, or sail over the sea to one another\\'s country\\nas people who have ships can do; if they had had these they would\\nhave colonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yield\\neverything in due season. There are meadows that in some places come\\nright down to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious grass;\\ngrapes would do there excellently; there is level land for ploughing,\\nand it would always yield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is\\ndeep. There is a good harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet\\nanchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has to do is to beach\\none\\'s vessel and stay there till the wind becomes fair for putting\\nout to sea again. At the head of the harbour there is a spring of\\nclear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplars growing all\\nround it. \\n\\n\"Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have\\nbrought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick\\nmist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass of\\nclouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked\\nfor it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore\\nbefore we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we\\nhad beached the ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped\\nupon the beach till daybreak. \\n\\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we admired\\nthe island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove\\'s daughters\\nroused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner.\\nOn this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships,\\nand dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats.\\nHeaven sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each\\nship got nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong\\nday to the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill,- and we\\nhad plenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full\\nwhen we sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out.\\nWhile we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of\\nthe Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble\\nfires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating\\nof their sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on\\ndark, we camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.\\n\\n\"\\'Stay here, my brave fellows,\\' said I, \\'all the rest of you, while\\nI go with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if\\nthey are uncivilized savages, or a hospitable and humane race.\\'\\n\\n\"I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers;\\nso they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.\\nWhen we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of\\na cliff near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It\\nwas a station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there\\nwas a large yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built into\\nthe ground and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of a\\nhuge monster who was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He\\nwould have nothing to do with other people, but led the life of an\\noutlaw. He was a horrid creature, not like a human being at all, but\\nresembling rather some crag that stands out boldly against the sky\\non the top of a high mountain. \\n\\n\"I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were,\\nall but the twelve best among them, who were to go along with myself.\\nI also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me\\nby Maron, Apollo son of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron\\ngod of Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple.\\nWhen we were sacking the city we respected him, and spared his life,\\nas also his wife and child; so he made me some presents of great value-\\nseven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars\\nof sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a\\nman nor maid in the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife,\\nand one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water\\nto one of wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so\\nexquisite that it was impossible to refrain from drinking. I filled\\na large skin with this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions\\nwith me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to deal with some\\nsavage who would be of great strength, and would respect neither right\\nnor law. \\n\\n\"We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went\\ninside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were\\nloaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens\\ncould hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the\\nhoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very\\nyoung ones all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all\\nthe vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimming\\nwith whey. When they saw all this, my men begged me to let them first\\nsteal some cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; they would\\nthen return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and\\nsail away with them. It would have been indeed better if we had done\\nso but I would not listen to them, for I wanted to see the owner himself,\\nin the hope that he might give me a present. When, however, we saw\\nhim my poor men found him ill to deal with. \\n\\n\"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others\\nof them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with\\nhis sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry\\nfirewood to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with\\nsuch a noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for\\nfear at the far end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes\\ninside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk, leaving\\nthe males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled\\na huge stone to the mouth of the cave- so huge that two and twenty\\nstrong four-wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it from its\\nplace against the doorway. When he had so done he sat down and milked\\nhis ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of them have\\nher own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker\\nstrainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that he might drink\\nit for his supper. When he had got through with all his work, he lit\\nthe fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said: \\n\\n\"\\'Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or\\ndo you sail the as rovers, with your hands against every man, and\\nevery man\\'s hand against you?\\' \\n\\n\"We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous\\nform, but I managed to say, \\'We are Achaeans on our way home from\\nTroy, but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been\\ndriven far out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son\\nof Atreus, who has won infinite renown throughout the whole world,\\nby sacking so great a city and killing so many people. We therefore\\nhumbly pray you to show us some hospitality, and otherwise make us\\nsuch presents as visitors may reasonably expect. May your excellency\\nfear the wrath of heaven, for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes\\nall respectable travellers under his protection, for he is the avenger\\nof all suppliants and foreigners in distress.\\' \\n\\n\"To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, \\'Stranger,\\' said he, \\'you\\nare a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me,\\nindeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes\\ndo not care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever\\nso much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your\\ncompanions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for\\ndoing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came\\non shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the\\nland?\\' \\n\\n\"He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught in\\nthat way, so I answered with a lie; \\'Neptune,\\' said I, \\'sent my ship\\non to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We\\nwere driven on to them from the open sea, but I and those who are\\nwith me escaped the jaws of death.\\' \\n\\n\"The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a\\nsudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them\\ndown upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains\\nwere shed upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood.\\nThen he tore them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled\\nthem up like a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails,\\nwithout leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up\\nour hands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not\\nknow what else to do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch,\\nand had washed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk,\\nhe stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep,\\nand went to sleep. I was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw\\nit, and drive it into his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we\\nshould all certainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift\\nthe stone which the monster had put in front of the door. So we stayed\\nsobbing and sighing where we were till morning came. \\n\\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, he again\\nlit his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then\\nlet each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with\\nall his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating\\nthem for his morning\\'s meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled\\nthe stone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once\\nput it back again- as easily as though he were merely clapping the\\nlid on to a quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted,\\nand cried \\'Shoo, shoo,\\' after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain;\\nso I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering\\nmyself with glory. \\n\\n\"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows. The\\nCyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;\\nit was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it\\nfor a staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could\\nonly compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large\\nburden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club\\nand cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men\\nand told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded\\nto do, and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end\\nin the fire to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under\\ndung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told the men to\\ncast lots which of them should venture along with myself to lift it\\nand bore it into the monster\\'s eye while he was asleep. The lot fell\\nupon the very four whom I should have chosen, and I myself made five.\\nIn the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and drove his\\nflocks into the cave- this time driving them all inside, and not leaving\\nany in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god\\nmust have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back\\nto its place against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his\\ngoats all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one;\\nwhen he had got through with all this work, he gripped up two more\\nof my men, and made his supper off them. So I went up to him with\\nan ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands: \\n\\n\"\\'Look here, Cyclops,\\' said I, you have been eating a great deal of\\nman\\'s flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what\\nkind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as\\na drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon\\nme and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping\\nand raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed yourself; how\\ncan you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in\\nthis way?\\' \\n\\n\"He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste\\nof the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. \\'Be so kind,\\'\\nhe said, \\'as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once.\\nI want to make you a present that you will be glad to have. We have\\nwine even in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens\\nthem, but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.\\'\\n\\n\"I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,\\nand three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when\\nI saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly\\nas I could: \\'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give\\nme, therefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this\\nis what my father and mother and my friends have always called me.\\'\\n\\n\"But the cruel wretch said, \\'Then I will eat all Noman\\'s comrades\\nbefore Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the\\npresent that I will make him.\\' \\n\\nAs he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.\\nHis great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon\\nhim. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets\\nof human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk.\\nThen I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and\\nencouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When\\nthe wood, green though it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of\\nthe fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven\\nhad filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the\\nbeam into the monster\\'s eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight\\nI kept turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in\\na ship\\'s plank with an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap\\ncan keep on turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore\\nthe red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all\\nover it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the\\nburning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of\\nthe eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet\\ninto cold water to temper it- for it is this that gives strength to\\nthe iron- and it makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the\\nCyclops\\' eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells\\nmade the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, but he plucked\\nthe beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and hurled it from\\nhim in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so to the other\\nCyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they gathered\\nfrom all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked\\nwhat was the matter with him. \\n\\n\"\\'What ails you, Polyphemus,\\' said they, \\'that you make such a noise,\\nbreaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being\\nable to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no\\nman is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force? \\n\\n\"But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, \\'Noman is killing\\nme by fraud! Noman is killing me by force!\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Then,\\' said they, \\'if no man is attacking you, you must be ill;\\nwhen Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better\\npray to your father Neptune.\\' \\n\\n\"Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my\\nclever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,\\nfelt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from\\nthe door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front\\nof it to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might\\nbe foolish enough to attempt this. \\n\\n\"As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my\\nown life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one\\nwho knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great.\\nIn the end I deemed that this plan would be the best. The male sheep\\nwere well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them\\nnoiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which\\nthe wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man under the\\nmiddle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that\\nthere were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram\\nfiner than any of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back,\\nesconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and flung on patiently\\nto his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the time.\\n\\n\"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came,\\nbut when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male\\nsheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about\\nthe pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting;\\nbut their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the\\nsheep as they stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out\\nthat the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was going out,\\nlast of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty\\nself; Polyphemus laid hold of it and said: \\n\\n\"\\'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave\\nthis morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but\\nlead the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain,\\nand are the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last\\nof all. Is it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are\\nsorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him down\\nin his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you\\ncould understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding,\\nand I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over\\nthe cave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm a this\\nno-good Noman has done me.\\' \\n\\n\"As spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way\\nout from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram\\'s belly,\\nand then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat,\\nby constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive\\nthem down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of\\nus who had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops\\nhad killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning\\nthat they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the\\nsheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took\\ntheir places, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I\\nhad got as far out as my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the\\nCyclops. \\n\\n\"\\'Cyclops,\\' said I, \\'you should have taken better measure of your\\nman before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up\\nyour visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin\\nwould find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished\\nyou.\\' \\n\\n\"He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from\\noff a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that\\nit was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked\\nas the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried\\nus back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But\\nI snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my\\nmen by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon\\nthey laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were\\nbefore, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged\\nand prayed of me to hold my tongue. \\n\\n\"\\'Do not,\\' they exclaimed, \\'be mad enough to provoke this savage creature\\nfurther; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back\\nagain to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us;\\nif he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have pounded\\nour heads and our ship\\'s timbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks\\nhe would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.\\'\\n\\n\"But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage,\\n\\'Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and\\nspoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of\\nLaertes, who lives in Ithaca.\\' \\n\\n\"On this he groaned, and cried out, \\'Alas, alas, then the old prophecy\\nabout me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a\\nman both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was\\nan excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till\\nhe grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day,\\nand said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been\\nall along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength,\\nwhereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has\\nmanaged to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come\\nhere, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents to show my hospitality,\\nand urge Neptune to help you forward on your journey- for Neptune\\nand I are father and son. He, if he so will, shall heal me, which\\nno one else neither god nor man can do.\\' \\n\\n\"Then I said, \\'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and\\nsending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take\\nmore than Neptune to cure that eye of yours.\\' \\n\\n\"On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed,\\nsaying, \\'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true-begotten\\nson, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must\\nget back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight\\nafter losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man\\'s\\nship and find trouble in his house.\\'] \\n\\n\"Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up\\na rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with\\nprodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a\\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock\\nfell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards\\non our way towards the shore of the island. \\n\\n\"When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our\\nships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting\\nour return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on\\nto the sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops\\' sheep, and divided them\\nequitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain. As\\nfor the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra\\nshare; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones\\nto Jove, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and\\nonly thought how he might destroy my ships and my comrades.\\n\\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted\\nour fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came\\non dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered\\nDawn, appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then\\nthey took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so\\nwe sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death\\nthough we had lost our comrades. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK X\\n\\nThence we went on to the Aeoli island where lives Aeolus son of Hippotas,\\ndear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it were)\\nupon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus has\\nsix daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry the daughters,\\nand they all live with their dear father and mother, feasting and\\nenjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the atmosphere\\nof the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats till it groans\\nagain, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well-made bedsteads,\\neach with his own wife between the blankets. These were the people\\namong whom we had now come. \\n\\n\"Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the\\ntime about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans.\\nI told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I\\nmust go, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of\\ndifficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me\\na prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut\\nup in the hide as in a sack- for Jove had made him captain over the\\nwinds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his\\nown pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly\\nwith a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow\\nfrom any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone\\nlet blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were lost\\nthrough our own folly. \\n\\n\"Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native\\nland showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the\\nstubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light\\nsleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we\\nmight get home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among themselves,\\nand said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus\\nhad given me. \\'Bless my heart,\\' would one turn to his neighbour, saying,\\n\\'how this man gets honoured and makes friends to whatever city or\\ncountry he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from Troy,\\nwhile we, who have travelled just as far as he has, come back with\\nhands as empty as we set out with- and now Aeolus has given him ever\\nso much more. Quick- let us see what it all is, and how much gold\\nand silver there is in the sack he gave him.\\' \\n\\n\"Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,\\nwhereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried\\nus weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke,\\nand knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and\\nmake the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down\\nin the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore\\nour fleet back to the Aeolian island. \\n\\n\"When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard\\nby the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of\\nmy men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him\\nfeasting with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on\\nthe threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, \\'Ulysses,\\nwhat brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took\\ngreat pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever\\nit was that you wanted to go to.\\' \\n\\n\"Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, \\'My men have undone\\nme; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this\\nmischief, for you can if you will.\\' \\n\\n\"I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their\\nfather answered, \\'Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the\\nisland; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for\\nyou come here as one abhorred of heaven. \"And with these words he\\nsent me sorrowing from his door. \\n\\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and\\nfruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six\\ndays, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached\\nthe rocky stronghold of Lamus- Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians,\\nwhere the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]\\nsalutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers\\nthe salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep might\\nearn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd,\\nfor they work much the same by night as they do by day. \\n\\n\"When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep cliffs,\\nwith a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took all\\ntheir ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there\\nwas never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead\\ncalm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very\\nend of the point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but could\\nsee no sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from\\nthe ground. So I sent two of my company with an attendant to find\\nout what sort of people the inhabitants were. \\n\\n\"The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the\\npeople draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till\\npresently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water,\\nand who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was\\ngoing to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their\\nwater, and when my men had come close up to her, they asked her who\\nthe king of that country might be, and over what kind of people he\\nruled; so she directed them to her father\\'s house, but when they got\\nthere they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain,\\nand they were horrified at the sight of her. \\n\\n\"She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly,\\nand forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them,\\nand began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other\\ntwo ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates\\nraised a hue and cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians\\nsprang up from every quarter- ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks\\nat us from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard\\nthe horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and\\nthe death cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like\\nfishes and took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing\\nmy men within the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own\\nship, and told my men to row with alf their might if they too would\\nnot fare like the rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were\\nthankful enough when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks\\nthey hurled at us. As for the others there was not one of them left.\\n\\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we\\nhad lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe\\nlives a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician\\nAeetes- for they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter\\nto Oceanus. We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word,\\nfor some god guided us thither, and having landed we there for two\\ndays and two nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of\\nthe third day came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from\\nthe ship to reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human\\nhandiwork, or hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high\\nlook-out I espied the smoke of Circe\\'s house rising upwards amid a\\ndense forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having\\nseen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more, but in\\nthe end I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men their\\ndinners, and send some of them instead of going myself. \\n\\n\"When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my\\nsolitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my\\npath. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the\\nriver, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck\\nhim in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went\\nclean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life\\nwent out of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the\\nwound, and laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and\\ntwisted them into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I\\nbound the four feet of the noble creature together; having so done\\nI hung him round my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon\\nmy spear, for the stag was much too big for me to be able to carry\\nhim on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down\\nin front of the ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by\\nman to each of them. \\'Look here my friends,\\' said I, \\'we are not going\\nto die so much before our time after all, and at any rate we will\\nnot starve so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.\\'\\nOn this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired\\nthe stag, for he was indeed a splendid fellow. Then, when they had\\nfeasted their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands\\nand began to cook him for dinner. \\n\\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed\\nthere eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and\\nit came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning,\\nfingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, \\'My friends,\\nwe are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have\\nno idea where the sun either sets or rises, so that we do not even\\nknow East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must\\ntry and find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high\\nas I could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to\\nthe horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising\\nfrom out of a thick forest of trees.\\' \\n\\n\"Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they\\nhad been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage\\nogre Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was\\nnothing to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies\\nand set a captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while\\nI took command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet,\\nand the lot fell upon Eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two\\nmen, and they wept, as also did we who were left behind.\\n\\n\"When they reached Circe\\'s house they found it built of cut stones,\\non a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest.\\nThere were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it- poor\\nbewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged\\ninto subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great\\ntails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them.\\nAs hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming from dinner-\\nfor they know he will bring them something- even so did these wolves\\nand lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the men were\\nterribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures. Presently they\\nreached the gates of the goddess\\'s house, and as they stood there\\nthey could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked\\nat her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours\\nas no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued\\nand trusted more than any other of my men, said, \\'There is some one\\ninside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place\\nresounds with it, let us call her and see whether she is woman or\\ngoddess.\\' \\n\\n\"They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade\\nthem enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus,\\nwho suspected mischief and stayed outside. When she had got them into\\nher house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess\\nwith cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian but she drugged it with wicked\\npoisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she\\nturned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in\\nher pigsties. They were like pigs-head, hair, and all, and they grunted\\njust as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they\\nremembered everything. \\n\\n\"Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some\\nacorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back\\nto tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome\\nwith dismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to\\ndo so; his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh,\\ntill at last we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had\\nhappened to the others. \\n\\n\"\\'We went,\\' said he, as you told us, through the forest, and in the\\nmiddle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place\\nthat could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was\\na goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted\\nto her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door,\\nand invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they\\nfollowed her into the house, but I stayed where I was, for I thought\\nthere might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more,\\nfor not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching\\nfor them.\\' \\n\\n\"Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I\\nalso took my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and show\\nme the way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously,\\nsaying, \\'Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here,\\nfor I know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even\\nreturn alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any\\nrate with the few that are left us, for we may still save our lives.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Stay where you are, then, \\'answered I, \\'eating and drinking at the\\nship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.\\'\\n\\n\"With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through\\nthe charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress\\nCirce, I met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man\\nin the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon\\nhis face. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying,\\n\\'My poor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top,\\nalone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe\\'s\\npigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not\\nfancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never\\nget back and will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never\\nmind, I will protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take\\nthis herb, which is one of great virtue, and keep it about you when\\nyou go to Circe\\'s house, it will be a talisman to you against every\\nkind of mischief. \\n\\n\"\\'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will\\ntry to practise upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and\\nshe will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be\\nable to charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you\\nwill prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it.\\nWhen Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon\\nher as though you were goings to kill her. She will then be frightened\\nand will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not point\\nblank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions free, and\\nto take good care also of yourself, but you make her swear solemnly\\nby all the blessed that she will plot no further mischief against\\nyou, or else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make\\nyou fit for nothing.\\' \\n\\n\"As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed me what\\nit was like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as\\nmilk; the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but\\nthe gods can do whatever they like. \\n\\n\"Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island;\\nbut I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded\\nwith care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there\\nand called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down,\\nopened the door, and asked me to come in; so I followed her- much\\ntroubled in my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid\\nwith silver, there was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed\\na mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for\\nshe meant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it\\nwithout its charming me, she struck she, struck me with her wand.\\n\\'There now,\\' she cried, \\'be off to the pigsty, and make your lair\\nwith the rest of them.\\' \\n\\n\"But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,\\nwhereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously,\\nsaying, \\'Who and whence are you? from what place and people have you\\ncome? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you? Never\\nyet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I gave\\nyou; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than the\\nbold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here some day\\nwith his ship while on his way home form Troy; so be it then; sheathe\\nyour sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends and learn\\nto trust each other.\\' \\n\\n\"And I answered, \\'Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with\\nyou when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now\\nthat you have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask\\nme to go to bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing.\\nI shall certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will\\nfirst take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.\\'\\n\\n\"So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed\\nher oath then I went to bed with her. \\n\\n\"Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their\\nwork. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the\\nholy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair\\npurple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another\\nbrought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets\\nof gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl\\nand put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth she brought\\nin water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which\\nshe had lighted. When the water in the cauldron was boiling, she poured\\ncold into it till it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in\\na bath and began washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders,\\nto take the tire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had\\ndone washing me and anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good\\ncloak and shirt and led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with\\nsilver; there was a footstool also under my feet. A maid servant then\\nbrought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver\\nbasin for me to wash my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me;\\nan upper servant brought me bread and offered me many things of what\\nthere was in the house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not,\\nand sat without heeding what was before me, still moody and suspicious.\\n\\n\"When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief,\\nshe came to me and said, \\'Ulysses, why do you sit like that as though\\nyou were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and\\ndrink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for\\nI have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.\\'\\n\\n\"And I said, \\'Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think\\nof either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his\\nfriends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink,\\nyou must free my men and bring them to me that I may see them with\\nmy own eyes.\\' \\n\\n\"When I had said this she went straight through the court with her\\nwand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors. My men came out like\\nso many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among\\nthem and anointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that\\nthe bad drug had given them fell off, and they became men again, younger\\nthan they were before, and much taller and better looking. They knew\\nme at once, seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till\\nthe whole house was filled with the sound of their hullabalooing,\\nand Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and\\nsaid, \\'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where\\nyou have left your ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide\\nall your ship\\'s gear and property in some cave, and come back here\\nwith your men.\\' \\n\\n\"I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the\\nmen at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw\\nme the silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves\\nbreak out and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming\\nhome to be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead\\nresounds with their lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though\\nthey had got back to their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been\\nborn and bred. \\'Sir,\\' said the affectionate creatures, \\'we are as\\nglad to see you back as though we had got safe home to Ithaca; but\\ntell us all about the fate of our comrades.\\' \\n\\n\"I spoke comfortingly to them and said, \\'We must draw our ship on\\nto the land, and hide the ship\\'s gear with all our property in some\\ncave; then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe\\'s house,\\nwhere you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst\\nof great abundance.\\' \\n\\n\"On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried\\nto hold them back and said, \\'Alas, poor wretches that we are, what\\nwill become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of\\nCirce, who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall\\nhave to keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated\\nus when our comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them.\\nIt was all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.\\'\\n\\n\"When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen\\nblade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of\\nhis being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him\\nand said, \\'Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and mind\\nthe ship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe\\'s house.\\'\\n\\n\"On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after\\nall, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand\\nthat I had given him. \\n\\n\"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind\\nwere washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them woollen\\ncloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably\\nat dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other face to\\nface and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till\\nthe whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said,\\n\\'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men to leave off crying;\\nI know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you\\nhave fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now,\\nso stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and\\nhearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you are weakened\\nboth in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking of the hardships-\\nyou have suffered during your travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness\\nleft in you.\\' \\n\\n\"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole\\ntwelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine.\\nBut when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days\\nhad come round, my men called me apart and said, \\'Sir, it is time\\nyou began to think about going home, if so be you are to be spared\\nto see your house and native country at all.\\' \\n\\n\"Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong\\nday to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine,\\nbut when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves\\ndown to sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got\\ninto bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened\\nto what I had got to say. \\'Circe,\\' said I, \\'please to keep the promise\\nyou made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get\\nback and so do my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints\\nas soon as ever your back is turned.\\' \\n\\n\"And the goddess answered, \\'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall\\nnone of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there\\nis another journey which you have got to take before you can sail\\nhomewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine\\nto consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias whose reason\\nis still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding\\neven in death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.\\'\\n\\n\"I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would\\ngladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently\\nwhen I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, \\'And\\nwho shall guide me upon this voyage- for the house of Hades is a port\\nthat no ship can reach.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'You will want no guide,\\' she answered; \\'raise you mast, set your\\nwhite sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there\\nof itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you\\nwill reach the fertile shore of Proserpine\\'s country with its groves\\nof tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach\\nyour ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark\\nabode of Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon\\nand Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron,\\nand you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers\\nrun into one another. \\n\\n\"\\'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench\\na cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a\\ndrink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then\\nwine, and in the third place water-sprinkling white barley meal over\\nthe whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble\\nghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will\\nsacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load\\nthe pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that\\nTeiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all\\nyour flocks. \\n\\n\"\\'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers,\\noffer them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus;\\nbut yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards\\nthe river. On this, many dead men\\'s ghosts will come to you, and you\\nmust tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just killed,\\nand offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to Proserpine.\\nThen draw your sword and sit there, so as to prevent any other poor\\nghost from coming near the split blood before Teiresias shall have\\nanswered your questions. The seer will presently come to you, and\\nwill tell you about your voyage- what stages you are to make, and\\nhow you are to sail the see so as to reach your home.\\' \\n\\n\"It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed\\nme in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light\\ngossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle\\nround her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went\\nabout among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly\\nto each of them man by man: \\'You must not lie sleeping here any longer,\\'\\nsaid I to them, \\'we must be going, for Circe has told me all about\\nit.\\' And this they did as I bade them. \\n\\n\"Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We\\nhad with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for\\nsense or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top\\naway from the rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool.\\nWhen he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on\\na sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so\\nhe tumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul went\\ndown to the house of Hades. \\n\\n\"When I had got the men together I said to them, \\'You think you are\\nabout to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead\\nof this, we have got to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to\\nconsult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.\\' \\n\\n\"The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves\\non the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend\\nmatters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting\\nour fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast\\nhard by the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing\\nit, for who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does\\nnot wish to be seen? \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XI\\n\\nThen, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into\\nthe water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep\\non board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind.\\nCirce, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew\\ndead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our sails all the time\\nwell filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship\\'s gear and\\nlet her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails\\nwere full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went\\ndown and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters\\nof the river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians\\nwho live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun\\nnever pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of\\nthe heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night.\\nWhen we got there we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her,\\nand went along by the waters of Oceanus till we came to the place\\nof which Circe had told us. \\n\\n\"Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword\\nand dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all\\nthe dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with\\nwater, and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly\\nto the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I got back\\nto Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best I had,\\nand would load the pyre with good things. I also particularly promised\\nthat Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best in all\\nmy flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats\\nof the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon the\\nghosts came trooping up from Erebus- brides, young bachelors, old\\nmen worn out with toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave\\nmen who had been killed in battle, with their armour still smirched\\nwith blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench\\nwith a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with\\nfear. When I saw them coming I told the men to be quick and flay the\\ncarcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them,\\nand at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine;\\nbut I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor\\nfeckless ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered\\nmy questions. \\n\\n\"The first ghost \\'that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he\\nhad not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked\\nand unburied in Circe\\'s house, for we had had too much else to do.\\nI was very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: \\'Elpenor,\\' said\\nI, \\'how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have\\nhere on foot quicker than I have with my ship.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Sir,\\' he answered with a groan, \\'it was all bad luck, and my own\\nunspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe\\'s\\nhouse, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase\\nbut fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul down to\\nthe house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have\\nleft behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father\\nwho brought you up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is\\nthe one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that\\nwhen you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean\\nisland. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you,\\nor I may bring heaven\\'s anger upon you; but burn me with whatever\\narmour I have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell\\npeople in days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant\\nover my grave the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and\\nwith my messmates.\\' And I said, \\'My poor fellow, I will do all that\\nyou have asked of me.\\' \\n\\n\"Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the\\none side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the\\nghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then\\ncame the ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus.\\nI had left her alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears\\nwhen I saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her\\ncome near the blood till I had asked my questions of Teiresias.\\n\\n\"Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre\\nin his hand. He knew me and said, \\'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,\\nwhy, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit\\nthe dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw\\nyour sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your questions\\ntruly.\\' \\n\\n\"So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank\\nof the blood he began with his prophecy. \\n\\n\"You want to know,\\' said he, \\'about your return home, but heaven will\\nmake this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye\\nof Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having\\nblinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home if you\\ncan restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the\\nThrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging\\nto the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. If you leave these\\nflocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting home, you may\\nyet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I\\nforewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men.\\nEven though you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight\\nafter losing all your men, [in another man\\'s ship, and you will find\\ntrouble in your house, which will be overrun by high-handed people,\\nwho are devouring your substance under the pretext of paying court\\nand making presents to your wife. \\n\\n\"\\'When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and\\nafter you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you\\nmust take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to\\na country where the people have never heard of the sea and do not\\neven mix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about ships,\\nand oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain\\ntoken which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and\\nwill say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your\\nshoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice\\na ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune. Then go home and offer hecatombs\\nto an the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death\\nshall come to you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very\\ngently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your people\\nshall bless you. All that I have said will come true].\\' \\n\\n\"\\'This,\\' I answered, \\'must be as it may please heaven, but tell me\\nand tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother\\'s ghost close by\\nus; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though\\nI am her own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me,\\nSir, how I can make her know me.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'That,\\' said he, \\'I can soon do Any ghost that you let taste of the\\nblood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not\\nlet them have any blood they will go away again.\\' \\n\\n\"On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for\\nhis prophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was\\nuntil my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at\\nonce and spoke fondly to me, saying, \\'My son, how did you come down\\nto this abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard\\nthing for the living to see these places, for between us and them\\nthere are great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no\\nman can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are\\nyou all this time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have\\nyou never yet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Mother,\\' said I, \\'I was forced to come here to consult the ghost\\nof the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean\\nland nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but\\none long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set\\nout with Agamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the\\nTrojans. But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did\\nyou have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy\\npassage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the son whom\\nI left behind me; is my property still in their hands, or has some\\none else got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim\\nit? Tell me again what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she\\nis; does she live with my son and guard my estate securely, or has\\nshe made the best match she could and married again?\\' \\n\\n\"My mother answered, \\'Your wife still remains in your house, but she\\nis in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both\\nnight and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property,\\nand Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain\\nlargely, as of course he must, considering his position as a magistrate,\\nand how every one invites him; your father remains at his old place\\nin the country and never goes near the town. He has no comfortable\\nbed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of\\nthe fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when\\nthe warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a\\nbed of vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground. He grieves continually\\nabout your never having come home, and suffers more and more as he\\ngrows older. As for my own end it was in this wise: heaven did not\\ntake me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was I attacked\\nby any illness such as those that generally wear people out and kill\\nthem, but my longing to know what you were doing and the force of\\nmy affection for you- this it was that was the death of me.\\'\\n\\n\"Then I tried to find some way of embracing my mother\\'s ghost. Thrice\\nI sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each time\\nshe flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and being\\ntouched to the quick I said to her, \\'Mother, why do you not stay still\\nwhen I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms around one another\\nwe might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in the\\nhouse of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of\\ngrief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?\\' \\n\\n\"\\'My son,\\' she answered, \\'most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not\\nProserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when\\nthey are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;\\nthese perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has\\nleft the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream.\\nNow, however, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and\\nnote all these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the\\nwives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds\\nabout the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally.\\nIn the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that\\nhung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood\\nat once. So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned\\nher told me her race and lineage. \\n\\n\"The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife\\nof Cretheus the son of Aeolus. She fell in love with the river Enipeus\\nwho is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when\\nshe was taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as\\nher lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue\\nwave arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and\\ngod, whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.\\nWhen the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in\\nhis own and said, \\'Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of\\nthe gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this\\ntime twelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now\\ngo home, but hold your tongue and do not tell any one.\\' \\n\\n\"Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and\\nNeleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias\\nwas a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived\\nin Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson,\\nPheres, and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.\\n\\n\"Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of\\nhaving slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two\\nsons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates,\\nand built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could\\nnot hold Thebes till they had walled it. \\n\\n\"Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove\\nindomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,\\nand married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon. \\n\\n\"I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king OEdipodes whose awful lot\\nit was to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her\\nafter having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole\\nstory to the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief\\nfor the spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house\\nof the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the\\navenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother- to his ruing\\nbitterly thereafter. \\n\\n\"Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given\\npriceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son\\nof Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She\\nbore Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that marvellously\\nlovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus\\nwould only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles\\nfrom the grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The\\nonly man who would undertake to raid them was a certain excellent\\nseer, but the will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the\\ncattle caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full\\nyear had passed and the same season came round again, Iphicles set\\nhim at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven.\\nThus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished. \\n\\n\"And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons,\\nCastor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these\\nheroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for\\nby a special dispensation of Jove, they die and come to life again,\\neach one of them every other day throughout all time, and they have\\nthe rank of gods. \\n\\n\"After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace\\nof Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short\\nlived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,\\nand the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they\\nwere nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest.\\nThey threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried to\\nset Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the\\ntop of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would have\\ndone it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed\\nboth of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their\\ncheeks or chin. \\n\\n\"Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the\\nmagician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens,\\nbut he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her\\nin the island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.\\n\\n\"I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own\\nhusband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name\\nevery single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw,\\nand it is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew,\\nor here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.\"\\n\\nHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless\\nthroughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:\\n\\n\"What do you think of this man, O Phaecians? Is he not tall and good\\nlooking, and is he not Clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of\\nyou share in the distinction. Do not he a hurry to send him away,\\nnor niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great\\nneed, for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.\"\\n\\nThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among\\nthem, \"My friends,\" said he, \"what our august queen has just said\\nto us is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded\\nby it; but the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with\\nKing Alcinous.\" \\n\\n\"The thing shall be done,\" exclaimed Alcinous, \"as surely as I still\\nlive and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious\\nto get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow,\\nby which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum that I\\nmean to give him. As regards- his escort it will be a matter for you\\nall, and mine above all others as the chief person among you.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay\\nhere for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded\\nwith your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would redound\\ngreatly to my advantage, for I should return fuller-handed to my own\\npeople, and should thus be more respected and beloved by all who see\\nme when I get back to Ithaca.\" \\n\\n\"Ulysses,\" replied Alcinous, \"not one of us who sees you has any idea\\nthat you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people\\ngoing about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to\\nsee through them, but there is a style about your language which assures\\nme of your good disposition. Moreover you have told the story of your\\nown misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practised\\nbard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty\\nheroes who went to Troy at the same time with yourself, and perished\\nthere. The evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet\\nbed time- go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay\\nhere listening till to-morrow morning, so long as you will continue\\nto tell us of your adventures.\" \\n\\n\"Alcinous,\" answered Ulysses, \"there is a time for making speeches,\\nand a time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I\\nwill not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of\\nmy comrades who did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but perished\\non their return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.\\n\\n\"When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions,\\nthe ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up tome, surrounded\\nby those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon\\nas he had tasted the blood he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched\\nout his arms towards me to embrace me; but he had no strength nor\\nsubstance any more, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him.\\n\\'How did you come by your death,\\' said I, \\'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune\\nraise his winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did\\nyour enemies make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting\\nor sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of their\\nwives and city?\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Ulysses,\\' he answered, \\'noble son of Laertes, was not lost at sea\\nin any storm of Neptune\\'s raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon\\nthe mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me\\nbetween them. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered\\nme most miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house,\\nwhile all around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for\\nthe wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great\\nnobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general\\nengagement, or in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly\\npitiable as the way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing-bowl\\nand the loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with\\nour-blood. I heard Priam\\'s daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra\\nkilled her close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword\\nin my body, and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but\\nshe slipped away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my\\neyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world so cruel\\nand so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as\\nhers was. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to\\nbe welcomed home by my children and my servants, but her abominable\\ncrime has brought disgrace on herself and all women who shall come\\nafter- even on the good ones.\\' \\n\\n\"And I said, \\'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first\\nto last in the matter of their women\\'s counsels. See how many of us\\nfell for Helen\\'s sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched\\nmischief against too during your absence.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Be sure, therefore,\\' continued Agamemnon, \\'and not be too friendly\\neven with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly\\nwell yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about\\nthe rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for\\nPenelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We\\nleft her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out\\nfor Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man\\'s estate,\\nand he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another\\nas it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not even\\nallow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I\\ncould do so. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to your heart- do\\nnot tell people when you are bringing your ship to Ithaca, but steal\\na march upon them, for after all this there is no trusting women.\\nBut now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my\\nson Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta\\nwith Menelaus- for I presume that he is still living.\\' \\n\\n\"And I said, \\'Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether\\nyour son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does\\nnot know.\\' \\n\\n\"As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the\\nghost of Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax\\nwho was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the\\nson of Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously,\\nsaying, \\'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will you\\nundertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hades among\\nus silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labour no more?\\'\\n\\n\"And I said, \\'Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans,\\nI came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me about my\\nreturn home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get near\\nthe Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have been\\nin trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet\\nso fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored\\nby all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are\\nhere you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take\\nit so much to heart even if you are dead.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Say not a word,\\' he answered, \\'in death\\'s favour; I would rather\\nbe a paid servant in a poor man\\'s house and be above ground than king\\nof kings among the dead. But give me news about son; is he gone to\\nthe wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me\\nalso if you have heard anything about my father Peleus- does he still\\nrule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout\\nHellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could\\nI but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same strength\\nthat I had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of\\nTroy- could I but be as I then was and go even for a short time to\\nmy father\\'s house, any one who tried to do him violence or supersede\\nhim would soon me it.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'I have heard nothing,\\' I answered, \\'of Peleus, but I can tell you\\nall about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from\\nScyros with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was\\nalways first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and\\nI were the only two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting\\non the plain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men,\\nbut would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many\\na man did he kill in battle- I cannot name every single one of those\\nwhom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only\\nsay how he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who\\nwas the handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also\\nof the Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman\\'s bribes. Moreover,\\nwhen all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus\\nhad made, and it was left to me to settle when we should either open\\nthe door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders\\nand chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking\\nin every limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from\\nhis cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the horse-\\ngrasping the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing\\nfury against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he\\ngot his handsome share of the prize money and went on board (such\\nis the fortune of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown\\nspear nor in close combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great\\nchance.\\' \\n\\n\"When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across\\na meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning\\nthe prowess of his son. \\n\\n\"The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own\\nmelancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof-\\nstill angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about\\nthe armour of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the\\nTrojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never\\ngained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who\\nwas foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in\\nstature and prowess. \\n\\n\"When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, \\'Ajax, will you not\\nforget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that\\nhateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough\\nto lose such a tower of strength as you were to us. We mourned you\\nas much as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the\\nblame be laid on anything but on the spite which Jove bore against\\nthe Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel your destruction-\\ncome hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection, and\\nhear what I can tell you.\\' \\n\\n\"He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts;\\nnevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being\\nso angry, or I should have gone talking to him, only that there were\\nstill others among the dead whom I desired to see. \\n\\n\"Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand\\nsitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting\\nand standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his\\nsentences upon them. \\n\\n\"After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the\\nghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and\\nhe had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.\\n\\n\"And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering\\nsome nine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were\\ndigging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat\\nthem off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove\\'s\\nmistress Leto as she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.\\n\\n\"I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that\\nreached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never\\nreach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink,\\nit dried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry ground-\\nparched by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees, moreover, that\\nshed their fruit over his head- pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet\\nfigs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched out\\nhis hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to\\nthe clouds. \\n\\n\"And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone\\nwith both his hands. With hands and feet he\\' tried to roll it up to\\nthe top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over\\non to the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and the\\npitiless stone would come thundering down again on to the plain. Then\\nhe would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran\\noff him and the steam rose after him. \\n\\n\"After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for\\nhe is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to\\nwife, who is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming\\nround him like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as\\nnight with his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string,\\nglaring around as though ever on the point of taking aim. About his\\nbreast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous\\nfashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there\\nwas also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what\\nhe might, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knew\\nme at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, my poor Ulysses,\\nnoble son of Laertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind of life\\nthat I did when I was above ground? I was son of Jove, but I went\\nthrough an infinity of suffering, for I became bondsman to one who\\nwas far beneath me- a low fellow who set me all manner of labours.\\nHe once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound- for he did not think\\nhe could find anything harder for me than this, but I got the hound\\nout of Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped\\nme.\\' \\n\\n\"On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed\\nwhere I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me.\\nAnd I should have seen still other of them that are gone before, whom\\nI would fain have seen- Theseus and Pirithous glorious children of\\nthe gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered\\nsuch appalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest Proserpine should\\nsend up from the house of Hades the head of that awful monster Gorgon.\\nOn this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board\\nat once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places,\\nwhereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We had\\nto row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XII\\n\\n\"After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the\\nopen sea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there\\nis dawn and sunrise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to\\nthe sands and got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep\\nand waited till day should break. \\n\\n\"Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I\\nsent some men to Circe\\'s house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut\\nfirewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and\\nafter we had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral\\nrites. When his body and armour had been burned to ashes, we raised\\na cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed\\nthe oar that he had been used to row with. \\n\\n\"While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back\\nfrom the house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as\\nshe could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread,\\nmeat, and wine. Then she stood in the midst of us and said, \\'You have\\ndone a bold thing in going down alive to the house of Hades, and you\\nwill have died twice, to other people\\'s once; now, then, stay here\\nfor the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on with your voyage\\nat daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses\\nabout your course, and will explain everything to him so as to prevent\\nyour suffering from misadventure either by land or sea.\\'\\n\\n\"We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong\\nday to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it\\ncame on dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables\\nof the ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated\\naway from the others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all\\nabout our adventures. \\n\\n\"\\'So far so good,\\' said she, when I had ended my story, \\'and now pay\\nattention to what I am about to tell you- heaven itself, indeed, will\\nrecall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens\\nwho enchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too\\nclose and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will\\nnever welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble\\nhim to death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap\\nof dead men\\'s bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting\\noff them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men\\'s ears\\nwith wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen\\nyourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright\\non a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they must lash the rope\\'s\\nends to the mast itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening.\\nIf you beg and pray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you\\nfaster. \\n\\n\"\\'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you\\ncoherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; I\\nwill lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them\\nfor yourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against\\nwhich the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the\\nblessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird\\nmay pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father\\nJove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father\\nJove has to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever\\nyet came to these rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds\\nof fire are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men.\\nThe only vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the famous Argo\\non her way from the house of Aetes, and she too would have gone against\\nthese great rocks, only that Juno piloted her past them for the love\\nshe bore to Jason. \\n\\n\"\\'Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in\\na dark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear\\nnot even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands\\nand twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs\\nsheer up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle\\nof it there is a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus;\\nyou must take your ship this way, but the cave is so high up that\\nnot even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it\\nScylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be that\\nof a young hound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one-\\nnot even a god- could face her without being terror-struck. She has\\ntwelve mis-shapen feet, and six necks of the most prodigious length;\\nand at the end of each neck she has a frightful head with three rows\\nof teeth in each, all set very close together, so that they would\\ncrunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep within her\\nshady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,\\nfishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can\\ncatch, of the thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever\\nyet got past her without losing some men, for she shoots out all her\\nheads at once, and carries off a man in each mouth. \\n\\n\"\\'You will find the other rocks lie lower, but they are so close together\\nthat there is not more than a bowshot between them. [A large fig tree\\nin full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking whirlpool\\nof Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her waters,\\nand three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not there\\nwhen she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not save\\nyou; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you\\ncan, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Is there no way,\\' said I, \\'of escaping Charybdis, and at the same\\ntime keeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'You dare-devil,\\' replied the goddess, you are always wanting to\\nfight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even\\nby the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage,\\nextreme, rude, cruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your\\nbest chance will be to get by her as fast as ever you can, for if\\nyou dawdle about her rock while you are putting on your armour, she\\nmay catch you with a second cast of her six heads, and snap up another\\nhalf dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at full speed,\\nand roar out lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla\\'s dam, bad luck to\\nher; she will then stop her from making a second raid upon you.\\n\\n\"\\'You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see\\nmany herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god-\\nseven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in\\neach flock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number,\\nand they are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who are\\nchildren of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she\\nhad borne them and had done suckling them sent them to the Thrinacian\\nisland, which was a long way off, to live there and look after their\\nfather\\'s flocks and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and\\nthink of nothing but getting home, you may yet after much hardship\\nreach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction\\nboth of your ship and of your comrades; and even though you may yourself\\nescape, you will return late, in bad plight, after losing all your\\nmen.\\' \\n\\n\"Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,\\nwhereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men\\nto loose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her,\\ntook their places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars.\\nPresently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a\\nfair wind that blew dead aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping\\nour sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship\\'s\\ngear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her. \\n\\n\"Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, \\'My friends,\\nit is not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies\\nthat Circe has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that\\nwhether we live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First she\\nsaid we were to keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most beautifully\\nin a field of flowers; but she said I might hear them myself so long\\nas no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind me to the crosspiece\\nhalf way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so fast\\nthat I cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope\\'s ends to the\\nmast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more\\ntightly still.\\' \\n\\n\"I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we reached\\nthe island of the two Sirens, for the wind had been very favourable.\\nThen all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of\\nwind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails and\\nstowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened the water with\\nthe foam they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of\\nwax and cut it up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my\\nstrong hands till it became soft, which it soon did between the kneading\\nand the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears\\nof all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast as I stood\\nupright on the crosspiece; but they went on rowing themselves. When\\nwe had got within earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a\\ngood rate, the Sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began\\nwith their singing. \\n\\n\"\\'Come here,\\' they sang, \\'renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean\\nname, and listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without\\nstaying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song- and he who listens\\nwill go on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know all the\\nills that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before Troy,\\nand can tell you everything that is going to happen over the whole\\nworld.\\' \\n\\n\"They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them\\nfurther I made by frowning to my men that they should set me free;\\nbut they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound\\nme with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the\\nSirens\\' voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and unbound\\nme. \\n\\n\"Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from\\nwhich spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men\\nwere so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole\\nsea resounded with the rushing of the waters, but the ship stayed\\nwhere it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore,\\nand exhorted them man by man not to lose heart. \\n\\n\"\\'My friends,\\' said I, \\'this is not the first time that we have been\\nin danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops\\nshut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel\\nsaved us then, and we shall live to look back on all this as well.\\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row on with\\nmight and main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend\\nto them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these\\nsteaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and\\nbe over yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the\\ndeath of us.\\' \\n\\n\"So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster\\nScylla, for I knew the men would not on rowing if I did, but would\\nhuddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe\\'s\\nstrict instructions- I put on my armour. Then seizing two strong spears\\nI took my stand on the ship Is bows, for it was there that I expected\\nfirst to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my men so much\\nharm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though I strained my\\neyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over \\n\\n\"Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one\\nhand was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up\\nthe salt water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron\\nwhen it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the\\ntop of the rocks on either side. When she began to suck again, we\\ncould see the water all inside whirling round and round, and it made\\na deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We could see the\\nbottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were\\nat their wit\\'s ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and\\nwere expecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly\\nupon us and snatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after\\nboth ship and men, and in a moment I saw their hands and feet ever\\nso high above me, struggling in the air as Scylla was carrying them\\noff, and I heard them call out my name in one last despairing cry.\\nAs a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting rock throws\\nbait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes, and spears\\nthem with the ox\\'s horn with which his spear is shod, throwing them\\ngasping on to the land as he catches them one by one- even so did\\nScylla land these panting creatures on her rock and munch them up\\nat the mouth of her den, while they screamed and stretched out their\\nhands to me in their mortal agony. This was the most sickening sight\\nthat I saw throughout all my voyages. \\n\\n\"When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible\\nCharybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were\\nthe goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still\\nat sea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing as they came home\\nto the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the blind\\nTheban prophet Teiresias had told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe\\nhad warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god. So being\\nmuch troubled I said to the men, \\'My men, I know you are hard pressed,\\nbut listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and\\nhow carefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed\\nsun-god, for it was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie.\\nHead the ship, therefore, away from the island.\\' \\n\\n\"The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an\\ninsolent answer. \\'Ulysses,\\' said he, \\'you are cruel; you are very\\nstrong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,\\nand now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep,\\nyou will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon\\nthis island, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly\\non through the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the\\nwinds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should\\none of those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which\\nso often wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious?\\nNow, therefore, let us obey the of night and prepare our supper here\\nhard by the ship; to-morrow morning we will go on board again and\\nput out to sea.\\' \\n\\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that\\nheaven meant us a mischief and said, \\'You force me to yield, for you\\nare many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his\\nsolemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock\\nof sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either,\\nbut will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.\\'\\n\\n\"They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their\\noath we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of\\nfresh water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As\\nsoon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they began talking about\\ntheir poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set\\nthem weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound\\nsleep. \\n\\n\"In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their\\nplaces, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so\\nthat land and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang\\nforth out of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered\\nDawn, appeared, we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave\\nwherein the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called\\nthe men together in council. \\n\\n\"\\'My friends,\\' said I, \\'we have meat and drink in the ship, let us\\nmind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for\\nit; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees\\nand gives ear to everything. And again they promised that they would\\nobey. \\n\\n\"For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there\\nwas no other wind, but only South and East. As long as corn and wine\\nheld out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,\\nhowever, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced\\nto go further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking\\nwhatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One\\nday, therefore, I went up inland that I might pray heaven to show\\nme some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough to be clear\\nof all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from\\nthe wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus\\ntill by and by they sent me off into a sweet sleep. \\n\\n\"Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men, \\'Listen\\nto me,\\' said he, \\'my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but\\nthere is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best\\nof these cows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal Rods? If\\nwe ever get back to Ithaca, we can build a fine temple to the sun-god\\nand enrich it with every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined\\nto sink our ship out of revenge for these homed cattle, and the other\\ngods are of the same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water\\nonce for all and have done with it, than be starved to death by inches\\nin such a desert island as this is.\\' \\n\\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle,\\nso fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men, therefore\\ndrove in the best of them, and they all stood round them saying their\\nprayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there\\nwas no barley left. When they had done praying they killed the cows\\nand dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped\\nthem round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on\\ntop of them. They had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over\\nthe sacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little\\nwater from time to time while the inward meats were being grilled;\\nthen, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward\\nmeats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits.\\n\\n\"By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the\\nship and to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast\\nmeat, so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. \\'Father Jove,\\'\\nI exclaimed, \\'and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss,\\nyou have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have\\nsent me; see what fine work these men of mine have been making in\\nmy absence.\\' \\n\\n\"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had\\nbeen killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said\\nto the immortals, \\'Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in\\neverlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses\\' ship:\\nthey have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing\\nI loved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again.\\nIf they do not square accounts with me about my cows, I will go down\\nto Hades and shine there among the dead.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'Sun,\\' said Jove, \\'go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over\\nthe fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with\\na bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.\\'\\n\\n\"I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from the\\nmouth of Mercury. \\n\\n\"As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked each\\none of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for\\nthe cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to show\\nsigns and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about,\\nand the joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the meat,\\nwhether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.\\n\\n\"For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon\\nthem, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the\\nfury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts,\\nspread sail, and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from\\nthe island, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturn\\nraised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath\\nit. We not get on much further, for in another moment we were caught\\nby a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of the\\nmast so that it fell aft, while all the ship\\'s gear tumbled about\\nat the bottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman\\nin the ship\\'s stern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to\\npieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving, with no more\\nlife left in him. \\n\\n\"Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round\\nand round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning\\nstruck it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about\\nin the water round the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but the\\ngod presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again.\\n\\n\"I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel\\n(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in\\nthe direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong\\nstill hanging about it, and with this I lashed the mast and keel together,\\nand getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to\\ntake me. \\n\\n\"[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got\\ninto the South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back\\nto the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually\\nhappened, for I was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise\\nhad reacfied the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking\\ndown the salt sea water, but I was carried aloft toward the fig tree,\\nwhich I caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not plant\\nmy feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a long\\nway off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too high,\\ntoo vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung patiently\\non, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft again-\\nand a very long while it seemed. A juryman is not more glad to get\\nhome to supper, after having been long detained in court by troublesome\\ncases, than I was to see my raft beginning to work its way out of\\nthe whirlpool again. At last I let go with my hands and feet, and\\nfell heavily into the sea, bard by my raft on to which I then got,\\nand began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the father of gods\\nand men would not let her get further sight of me- otherwise I should\\nhave certainly been lost.] \\n\\n\"Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the\\ngods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and\\npowerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I\\nneed say no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all\\nabout it yesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and over\\nagain.\" \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XIII\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered\\ncloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous\\nbegan to speak. \\n\\n\"Ulysses,\" said he, \"now that you have reached my house I doubt not\\nyou will get home without further misadventure no matter how much\\nyou have suffered in the past. To you others, however, who come here\\nnight after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard,\\nI would insist as follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes,\\nwrought gold, and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;\\nlet us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a\\nlarge tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy\\nof a general rate; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear\\nthe burden of such a handsome present.\" \\n\\nEvery one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in\\nhis own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,\\nthey hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.\\nAlcinous went on board and saw everything so securely stowed under\\nthe ship\\'s benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the\\nrowers. Then they went to the house of Alcinous to get dinner, and\\nhe sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove who is the lord of\\nall. They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner, after\\nwhich the inspired bard, Demodocus, who was a favourite with every\\none, sang to them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the\\nsun, as though to hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on\\nhis way. As one who has been all day ploughing a fallow field with\\na couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when\\nnight comes that he may go and get it, for it is all his legs can\\ndo to carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down,\\nand he at once said to the Phaecians, addressing himself more particularly\\nto King Alcinous: \\n\\n\"Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send\\nme on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart\\'s desire by\\ngiving me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that\\nI may turn to good account; may I find my admirable wife living in\\npeace among friends, and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction\\nto your wives and children; may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace,\\nand may no evil thing come among your people.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and\\nagreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably.\\nAlcinous therefore said to his servant, \"Pontonous, mix some wine\\nand hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to father\\nJove, and speed our guest upon his way.\" \\n\\nPontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others\\neach from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that\\nlive in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the\\nhands of queen Arete. \\n\\n\"Farewell, queen,\" said he, \"henceforward and for ever, till age and\\ndeath, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now\\ntake my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people,\\nand with king Alcinous.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to conduct\\nhim to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some maid servants\\nwith him- one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his strong-box,\\nand a third with corn and wine. When they got to the water side the\\ncrew took these things and put them on board, with all the meat and\\ndrink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck\\nthat he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship. Then he too\\nwent on board and lay down without a word, but the crew took every\\nman his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone to which\\nit had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing out to sea, Ulysses\\nfell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber. \\n\\nThe ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies\\nover the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curveted as\\nit were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water\\nseethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a falcon,\\nswiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus, then,\\nshe cut her way through the water. carrying one who was as cunning\\nas the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all\\nthat he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves\\nof the weary sea. \\n\\nWhen the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show.\\nthe ship drew near to land. Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the\\nold merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the line\\nof the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms\\nof wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a\\nship may lie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour\\nthere is a large olive tree, and at no distance a fine overarching\\ncavern sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. There are mixing-bowls\\nwithin it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover,\\nthere are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes\\nof sea purple- very curious to see- and at all times there is water\\nwithin it. It has two entrances, one facing North by which mortals\\ncan go down into the cave, while the other comes from the South and\\nis more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the\\nway taken by the gods. \\n\\nInto this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the place,\\nShe had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length on to\\nthe shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thing they did\\nwas to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the ship,\\nand lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took out\\nthe presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him\\nwhen he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all\\ntogether by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear\\nsome passer by might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and\\nthen they made the best of their way home again. \\n\\nBut Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already threatened\\nUlysses, so he took counsel with Jove. \"Father Jove,\" said he, \"I\\nshall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods, if\\nmortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show\\nsuch small regard for me. I said I would Ulysses get home when he\\nhad suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never get\\nhome at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head about it,\\nand promised that he should do so; but now they have brought him in\\na ship fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him\\nwith more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he\\nwould ever have brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of\\nthe spoil and got home without misadventure.\" \\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking\\nabout? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would\\nbe monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are.\\nAs regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence\\nand treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself\\nto deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as you please.\"\\n\\n\"I should have done so at once,\" replied Neptune, \"if I were not anxious\\nto avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I should\\nlike to wreck the Phaecian ship as it is returning from its escort.\\nThis will stop them from escorting people in future; and I should\\nalso like to bury their city under a huge mountain.\" \\n\\n\"My good friend,\" answered Jove, \"I should recommend you at the very\\nmoment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her\\nway, to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship.\\nThis will astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under\\nthe mountain.\" \\n\\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where\\nthe Phaecians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making\\nrapid way, had got close-in. Then he went up to it, turned it into\\nstone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it\\nin the ground. After this he went away. \\n\\nThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would\\nturn towards his neighbour, saying, \"Bless my heart, who is it that\\ncan have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port?\\nWe could see the whole of her only moment ago.\" \\n\\nThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous\\nsaid, \"I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that\\nNeptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over\\nthe sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning\\nfrom an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain. This was\\nwhat my old father used to say, and now it is all coming true. Now\\ntherefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave\\noff giving people escorts when they come here, and in the next let\\nus sacrifice twelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy\\nupon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain.\" When the\\npeople heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls.\\n\\nThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaecians to king Neptune, standing\\nround his altar; and at the same time Ulysses woke up once more upon\\nhis own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again;\\nmoreover, Jove\\'s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that\\npeople might not know of his having come, and that she might tell\\nhim everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and\\nfriends recognizing him until he had taken his revenge upon the wicked\\nsuitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him- the\\nlong straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the goodly\\ntrees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native\\nland. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried\\naloud despairingly. \\n\\n\"Alas,\" he exclaimed, \"among what manner of people am I fallen? Are\\nthey savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane? Where shall\\nI put all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had stayed\\nover there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other\\ngreat chief who would have been good to me and given me an escort.\\nAs it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave\\nit here for fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good truth\\nthe chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly\\nby me, and have left me in the wrong country; they said they would\\ntake me back to Ithaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector\\nof suppliants chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes\\nthose who do wrong. Still, I suppose I must count my goods and see\\nif the crew have gone off with any of them.\" \\n\\nHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his\\nclothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about\\nnot being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore\\nof the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up\\nto him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien,\\nwith a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals\\non her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad\\nwhen he saw her, and went straight up to her. \\n\\n\"My friend,\" said he, \"you are the first person whom I have met with\\nin this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be will disposed\\ntowards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace\\nyour knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me, then,\\nand tell me truly, what land and country is this? Who are its inhabitants?\\nAm I on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?\"\\n\\nMinerva answered, \"Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have\\ncome from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this\\nis. It is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and\\nWest. It is rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no\\nmeans a bid island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity\\nof corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it\\nbreeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there\\nare watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name\\nof Ithaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a\\nlong way off from this Achaean country.\" \\n\\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own\\ncountry, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and\\nmade up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\\n\\n\"I heard of Ithaca,\" said he, \"when I was in Crete beyond the seas,\\nand now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have\\nleft as much more behind me for my children, but am flying because\\nI killed Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete.\\nI killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from\\nTroy with so much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and\\nby the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served his father\\nloyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent\\nruler, so I lay in wait for him and with one of my followers by the\\nroad side, and speared him as he was coming into town from the country.\\nmy It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore,\\nthat I had killed him, but as soon as I had done so I went to a ship\\nand besought the owners, who were Phoenicians, to take me on board\\nand set me in Pylos or in Elis where the Epeans rule, giving them\\nas much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile, but the wind\\ndrove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither\\nby night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none\\nof us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all\\nwent on shore and lay down just as we were. I was very tired and fell\\nasleep directly, so they took my goods out of the ship, and placed\\nthem beside me where I was lying upon the sand. Then they sailed away\\nto Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress of mind.\"\\n\\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand.\\nThen she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, \"He must\\nbe indeed a shifty lying fellow,\" said she, \"who could surpass you\\nin all manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist.\\nDare-devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can\\nyou not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now\\nthat you are in your own country again? We will say no more, however,\\nabout this, for we can both of us deceive upon occasion- you are the\\nmost accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I\\nfor diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not\\nknow Jove\\'s daughter Minerva- me, who have been ever with you, who\\nkept watch over you in all your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians\\ntake so great a liking to you? And now, again, I am come here to talk\\nthings over with you, and help you to hide the treasure I made the\\nPhaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the troubles that await\\nyou in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell no one,\\nneither man nor woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything,\\nand put up with every man\\'s insolence, without a word.\" \\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but\\nyou are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets\\nyou it is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not.\\nThis much, however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to\\nme as long as we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the\\nday on which we went on board ship after having sacked the city of\\nPriam, and heaven dispersed us- from that day, Minerva, I saw no more\\nof you, and cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me\\nin a difficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered\\nme from evil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged\\nme and took me into the town. And now, I beseech you in your father\\'s\\nname, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in\\nIthaca. I am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving\\nme in all you have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really\\ngot back to my own country?\" \\n\\n\"You are always taking something of that sort into your head,\" replied\\nMinerva, \"and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions;\\nyou are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning\\nfrom so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife\\nand children, but you do not seem to care about asking after them\\nor hearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife,\\nwho remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no peace night\\nor day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming\\nnear you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would\\nget back safely though you would lose all your men, and I did not\\nwish to quarrel with my uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having\\nblinded his son. I will now, however, point out to you the lie of\\nthe land, and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven\\nof the old merman Phorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at\\nthe head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;] here too\\nis the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable\\nhecatomb to the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared.\\nThen Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and\\nkissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the\\nnymphs, saying, \"Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that\\nI was never again to see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving\\nsalutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if\\nJove\\'s redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to\\nmanhood.\" \\n\\n\"Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,\" rejoined Minerva,\\n\"let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave,\\nwhere they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it\\nall.\" \\n\\nTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding\\nplaces, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze,\\nand good clothing which the Phaecians had given him. They stowed everything\\ncarefully away, and Minerva set a stone against the door of the cave.\\nThen the two sat down by the root of the great olive, and consulted\\nhow to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors. \\n\\n\"Ulysses,\" said Minerva, \"noble son of Laertes, think how you can\\nlay hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in\\nyour house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding\\npresents to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving\\nhope and sending your encouraging messages to every one of them, but\\nmeaning the very opposite of all she says\\' \\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have\\ncome to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if\\nyou had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall\\nbest avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my\\nheart as on the day when we loosed Troy\\'s fair diadem from her brow.\\nHelp me now as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if\\nyou, goddess, will be with me.\" \\n\\n\"Trust me for that,\" said she, \"I will not lose sight of you when\\nonce we set about it, and I would imagine that some of those who are\\ndevouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their\\nblood and brains. I will begin by disguising you so that no human\\nbeing shall know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall\\nlose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall\\nfill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for\\nyou, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors,\\nof your wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then go at\\nonce to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always\\nwell affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son;\\nyou will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is called Raven\\nby the fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening on beechmast and\\nspring water after their manner. Stay with him and find out how things\\nare going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your son, who is with\\nMenelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out whether\\nyou are still alive.\" \\n\\n\"But why,\" said Ulysses, \"did you not tell him, for you knew all about\\nit? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship\\nwhile others are eating up his estate?\" \\n\\nMinerva answered, \"Never mind about him, I sent him that he might\\nbe well spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty,\\nbut is staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded\\nwith abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and\\nare lying in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can\\nget home. I do not much think they will succeed, but rather that some\\nof those who are now eating up your estate will first find a grave\\nthemselves.\" \\n\\nAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with\\nwrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over\\nhis whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine\\nones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about\\nhim, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also\\ngave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished\\nhim with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for\\nhim to sling it over his shoulder. \\n\\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess\\nwent straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XIV\\n\\nUlysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the\\nwooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached\\nthe place where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd,\\nwho was the most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front\\nof his hut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which\\ncould be seen from far. He had made them spacious and fair to see,\\nwith a free ran for the pigs all round them; he had built them during\\nhis master\\'s absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,\\nwithout saying anything to Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced\\nthem on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong\\nfence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while\\ninside lie had built twelve sties near one another for the sows to\\nlie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in each sty, all of them breeding\\nsows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for\\nthe suitors kept on eating them, and die swineherd had to send them\\nthe best he had continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar\\npigs, and the herdsman\\'s four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves,\\nslept always with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out\\na pair of sandals from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were\\nout herding the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the\\nfourth to town with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors\\nthat they might sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\\n\\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew\\nat him, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold\\nof the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn\\nby them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox\\nhide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the\\ndogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to\\nUlysses, \"Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work of\\nyou, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have given\\nme quite enough worries without that, for I have lost the best of\\nmasters, and am in continual grief on his account. I have to attend\\nswine for other people to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the\\nlight of day, is starving in some distant land. But come inside, and\\nwhen you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where you come\\nfrom, and all about your misfortunes.\" \\n\\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down.\\nHe strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top\\nof this he threw the shaggy chamois skin- a great thick one- on which\\nhe used to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus\\nwelcome, and said \"May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you\\nyour heart\\'s desire in return for the kind way in which you have received\\nme.\" \\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Stranger, though a still\\npoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult\\nhim, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what\\nyou can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have\\nyoung lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for\\nheaven has hindered the return of him who would have been always good\\nto me and given me something of my own- a house, a piece of land,\\na good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant\\nwho has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered\\nas they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had\\ngrown old here he would have done great things by me, but he is gone,\\nand I wish that Helen\\'s whole race were utterly destroyed, for she\\nhas been the death of many a good man. It was this matter that took\\nmy master to Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans\\nin the cause of kin Agamemnon.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the sties where\\nthe young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought\\nback with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted\\non them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it\\nbefore Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled\\nit over with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a\\nbowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin.\\n\\n\"Fall to, stranger,\" said he, \"on a dish of servant\\'s pork. The fat\\npigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple;\\nbut the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and respect those\\nwho do what is lawful and right. Even the fierce free-booters who\\ngo raiding on other people\\'s land, and Jove gives them their spoil-\\neven they, when they have filled their ships and got home again live\\nconscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but some god\\nseems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they\\nwill not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers\\nof marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force, without\\nfear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice\\nnot one victim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for\\nhe was exceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on\\nthe mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men put\\ntogether. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of cattle\\nupon the mainland, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also twelve\\ndroves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers feed him twelve\\nwidely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even large\\nflocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in the\\ncharge of excellent goatherds. Each one of these sends the suitors\\nthe best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge\\nof the pigs that you see here, and I have to keep picking out the\\nbest I have and sending it to them.\" \\n\\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously\\nwithout a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and\\nwas satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,\\nfilled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and\\nsaid as he took it in his hands, \"My friend, who was this master of\\nyours that bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as\\nyou tell me? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell\\nme who he was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and\\nthe other gods know, but I may be able to give you news of him, for\\nI have travelled much.\" \\n\\nEumaeus answered, \"Old man, no traveller who comes here with news\\nwill get Ulysses\\' wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless,\\ntramps in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of\\nlies, and not a word of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca\\ngoes to my mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them\\nin, makes much of them, and asks them all manner of questions, crying\\nall the time as women will when they have lost their husbands. And\\nyou too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up\\na very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since\\ntorn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and\\nhis bones are lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he\\nis dead and gone, and a bad business it is for all his friends- for\\nme especially; go where I may I shall never find so good a master,\\nnot even if I were to go home to my mother and father where I was\\nbred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my parents now,\\nthough I should dearly like to see them again in my own country; it\\nis the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak of him\\nwithout reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond\\nof me, and took such care of me that whereever he may be I shall always\\nhonour his memory.\" \\n\\n\"My friend,\" replied Ulysses, \"you are very positive, and very hard\\nof belief about your master\\'s coming home again, nevertheless I will\\nnot merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me\\nanything for my news till he has actually come, you may then give\\nme a shirt and cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want,\\nbut I will not take anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even\\nas I hate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I\\nswear by king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth\\nof Ulysses to which I have now come, that all will surely happen as\\nI have said it will. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with\\nthe end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here\\nto do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his wife and son.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Old man, you will neither\\nget paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home;\\ndrink you wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do\\nnot keep on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any\\none speaks about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let\\nit alone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father\\nLaertes, and his son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about this\\nsame boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare\\nto be no worse man, face and figure, than his father, but some one,\\neither god or man, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone off\\nto Pylos to try and get news of his father, and the suitors are lying\\nin wait for him as he is coming home, in the hope of leaving the house\\nof Arceisius without a name in Ithaca. But let us say no more about\\nhim, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the son of Saturn\\nholds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man, tell me\\nyour own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you are and\\nwhere you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner\\nof ship you came in, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from what\\ncountry they professed to come- for you cannot have come by land.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I will tell you all about it. If there were\\nmeat and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing\\nto do but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could\\neasily talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the\\nstory of the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.\\n\\n\"I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well-to-do man, who had many\\nsons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had\\npurchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax\\n(whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour among\\nthe Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons)\\nput me on the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock.\\nWhen, however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided\\nhis estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding\\nand little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry into\\na rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the\\nfield of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw\\nyou can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to\\nspare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked\\nmy men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death\\nso much as a thought, but was the first to leap forward and spear\\nall whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care\\nabout farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring\\nup children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows-\\nthings that most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing\\nand another another, and this was what I was most naturally inclined\\nto. Before the Achaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command\\nof men and ships on foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I\\nhad my pick of the spoil in the first instance, and much more was\\nallotted to me later on. \\n\\n\"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but\\nwhen Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished,\\nthe people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy,\\nand there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing so.\\nThere we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked the\\ncity of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it\\nwas that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily\\nwith my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea\\nof making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned\\nit. I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six\\ndays I and my men made feast, and I found them many victims both for\\nsacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh day we\\nwent on board and set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind\\nus though we were going down a river. Nothing went ill with any of\\nour ships, and we had no sickness on board, but sat where we were\\nand let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth\\nday we reached the river Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the\\nriver, bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them while\\nI sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\\n\\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives\\nand children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and\\nwhen they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till\\nthe plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the\\ngleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would\\nno longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The\\nEgyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced\\nlabour for them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus- and\\nI wish I had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much\\nsorrow in store for me- I took off my helmet and shield and dropped\\nmy spear from my hand; then I went straight up to the king\\'s chariot,\\nclasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade\\nme get into his chariot, and took me weeping to his own home. Many\\nmade at me with their ashen spears and tried to kil me in their fury,\\nbut the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the protector\\nof strangers, who punishes those who do evil. \\n\\n\"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among\\nthe Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now\\ngoing on for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning\\nrascal, who had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this\\nman talked me over into going with him to Phoenicia, where his house\\nand his possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months,\\nbut at the end of that time when months and days had gone by till\\nthe same season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound\\nfor Libya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him\\nto that place, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take\\nthe money I fetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board\\nwith him, for I could not help it. \\n\\n\"The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea\\nthat lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled\\ntheir destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and\\ncould see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our\\nship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his\\nthunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled with\\nfire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all into\\nthe sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking\\nlike so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all\\nchance of getting home again. I was all dismayed; Jove, however, sent\\nthe ship\\'s mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung\\nto it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift\\nbut in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to\\nthe Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained\\nme hospitably without charging me anything at all for his son found\\nme when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised\\nme by the hand, took me to his father\\'s house and gave me clothes\\nto wear. \\n\\n\"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he\\nhad entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on\\nhis homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and\\nwrought iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep\\nhis family for ten generations, so much had he left in the house of\\nking Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he\\nmight learn Jove\\'s mind from the god\\'s high oak tree, and know whether\\nafter so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in\\nsecret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings\\nin his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side,\\nand the crew found, that should take him to his own country. He sent\\nme off however before Ulysses returned, for there happened to be a\\nThesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium,\\nand he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me safely to\\nKing Acastus. \\n\\n\"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to\\nthe very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out\\nfrom land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me\\nof the shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the\\ntattered old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall,\\nthey reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with\\na strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper\\nby the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having\\ndrawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where\\nI struck out and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore\\nnear a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at\\nmy having escaped and went searching about for me, till at last they\\nthought it was no further use and went back to their ship. The gods,\\nhaving hidden me thus easily, then took me to a good man\\'s door- for\\nit seems that I am not to die yet awhile.\" \\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Poor unhappy stranger,\\nI have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting,\\nbut that part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me\\nto believe it. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in\\nthis way? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and\\nall of them detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy,\\nor let him die with friends around him when the days of his fighting\\nwere done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\\nashes and his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the\\nstorm winds have spirited him away we know not whither. \\n\\n\"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go\\nto the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some\\nnews about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both\\nthose who grieve over the king\\'s absence, and those who rejoice at\\nit because they can eat up his property without paying for it. For\\nmy own part I have never cared about asking anyone else since the\\ntime when I was taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a man and\\ncome a long way till at last he reached my station, and I was very\\nkind to him. He said he had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the\\nCretans, refitting his ships which had been damaged in a gale. He\\nsaid Ulysses would return in the following summer or autumn with his\\nmen, and that he would bring back much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate\\nold man, since fate has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter\\nme in this way with vain hopes. It is not for any such reason that\\nI shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the god\\nof hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you.\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have\\ngiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make\\na bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your\\nmaster comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send\\nme to Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say\\nhe will, set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder\\nprecepice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling\\nlies.\" \\n\\n\"And a pretty figure I should cut then,\" replied Eumaeus, both now\\nand hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut\\nand showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good\\nearnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will\\ncome in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with\\nthe pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their sties, and\\na tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them.\\nBut Eumaeus called to his men and said, \"Bring in the best pig you\\nhave, that I may sacrifice for this stranger, and we will take toll\\nof him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding\\npigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour.\" \\n\\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a\\nfine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus\\ndid not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the\\nfirst thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig\\'s face and throw\\nthem into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses\\nmight return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of\\noak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and\\nstunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they\\ncut it up, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint\\non to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid\\nupon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces\\nupon the spits and roasted them till they were done; when they had\\ntaken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser in a heap.\\nThe swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood up to give\\nevery one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he set apart\\nfor Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he\\ndid so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses\\nsome slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour,\\nand Ulysses was much pleased. \"I hope, Eumaeus,\" said he, \"that Jove\\nwill be as well disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you\\nare showing to an outcast like myself.\" \\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Eat, my good fellow, and\\nenjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,\\njust as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice\\nto the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the\\ncup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulius\\nbrought them their bread; the swineherd had bought this man on his\\nown account from among the Taphians during his master\\'s absence, and\\nhad paid for him with his own money without saying anything either\\nto his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good\\nthings that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat\\nand drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they\\nall went to bed after having made a hearty supper. \\n\\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon.\\nIt poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West,\\nwhich is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus,\\nin the excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak\\nand give it him, or make one of his men give him one. \"Listen to me,\"\\nsaid he, \"Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I\\nwill tell you something. It is the wine that makes me talk in this\\nway; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will make\\nhim chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had better leave\\nunspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were\\nstill young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy.\\nMenelaus and Ulysses were the leaders, but I was in command also,\\nfor the other two would have it so. When we had come up to the wall\\nof the city we crouched down beneath our armour and lay there under\\ncover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about the swamp.\\nIt came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell small\\nand fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime.\\nThe others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough\\nwith their shields about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left\\nmy cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had\\ngone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds\\nthrough and the stars had shifted their their places, I nudged Ulysses\\nwho was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me his ear.\\n\\n\"\\'Ulysses,\\' said I, \\'this cold will be the death of me, for I have\\nno cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but\\nmy shirt, and I do not know what to do.\\' \\n\\n\"Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following\\nplan: \\n\\n\"\\'Keep still,\\' said he in a low voice, \\'or the others will hear you.\\'\\nThen he raised his head on his elbow. \\n\\n\"\\'My friends,\\' said he, \\'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep.\\nWe are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and\\ntell Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.\\' \\n\\n\"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running\\nto the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough\\ntill morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in\\nthose days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak\\nboth out of good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier;\\nbut now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby.\"\\n\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Old man, you have told us an excellent story,\\nand have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the\\npresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else\\nthat a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning\\nyou have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for we\\nhave not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only\\none. When Ulysses\\' son comes home again he will give you both cloak\\nand shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.\" \\n\\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some goatskins\\nand sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here Ulysses lay\\ndown, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he\\nkept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.\\n\\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the\\nswineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready\\nto go and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his property\\nduring his master\\'s absence. First he slung his sword over his brawny\\nshoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also took\\nthe skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack\\nfrom men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the pigs\\nwere camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from\\nthe North wind. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XV\\n\\nBut Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses\\'\\nson that he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping\\nin the forecourt of Menelaus\\'s house; Pisistratus was fast asleep,\\nbut Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy\\nfather, so Minerva went close up to him and said: \\n\\n\"Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer,\\nnor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house;\\nthey will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have\\nbeen on a fool\\'s errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if\\nyou wish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back.\\nHer father and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus,\\nwho has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatly\\nincreasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have\\nbeen taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women\\nare- they always want to do the best they can for the man who marries\\nthem, and never give another thought to the children of their first\\nhusband, nor to their father either when he is dead and done with.\\nGo home, therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable\\nwoman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to send\\nyou a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of another matter which\\nyou had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors are lying\\nin wait for you in the Strait between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean\\nto kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will\\nsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up\\nyour property will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and\\nkeep your ship well away from the islands; the god who watches over\\nyou and protects you will send you a fair wind. As soon as you get\\nto Ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself go straight\\nto the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is well disposed towards\\nyou, stay with him, therefore, for the night, and then send him to\\nPenelope to tell her that you have got back safe from Pylos.\"\\n\\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus\\nwith his heel to rouse him, and said, \"Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke\\nthe horses to the chariot, for we must set off home.\" \\n\\nBut Pisistratus said, \"No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive\\nin the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought\\nhis presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good-bye\\nto us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never forget\\na host who has shown him kindness.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,\\nleaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he\\nput on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his\\nshoulders, and went out to meet him. \"Menelaus,\" said he, \"let me\\ngo back now to my own country, for I want to get home.\" \\n\\nAnd Menelaus answered, \"Telemachus, if you insist on going I will\\nnot detain you. not like to see a host either too fond of his guest\\nor too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting\\na man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if\\nhe would like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he\\nis in the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then,\\ntill I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till\\nyou have yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient\\ndinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once\\nmore proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting\\nout on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making\\na tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and\\nwill conduct you myself through all our principal cities. No one will\\nsend us away empty handed; every one will give us something- a bronze\\ntripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.\" \\n\\n\"Menelaus,\" replied Telemachus, \"I want to go home at once, for when\\nI came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while\\nlooking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something\\nvaluable has been stolen during my absence.\" \\n\\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants\\nto prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house.\\nAt this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had\\njust got up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some\\nmeat, which he at once did. Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant\\nstore room, not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When\\nhe reached the place where the treasures of his house were kept, he\\nselected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also\\na silver mixing-bowl. Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she\\nkept the lovely dresses which she had made with her own hands, and\\ntook out one that was largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery;\\nit glittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest.\\nThen they all came back through the house again till they got to Telemachus,\\nand Menelaus said, \"Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno,\\nbring you safely home according to your desire. I will now present\\nyou with the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house.\\nIt is a mixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid\\nwith gold, and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians\\nmade me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while\\nI was on my return home. I should like to give it to you.\"\\n\\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,\\nwhile Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and set it before\\nhim. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\\n\\n\"I too, my son,\" said she, \"have something for you as a keepsake from\\nthe hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.\\nTill then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go\\nback rejoicing to your own country and to your home.\" \\n\\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly.\\nThen Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them\\nall as he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus\\ninto the house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant\\nbrought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into\\na silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean\\ntable beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered\\nthem many good things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved\\nthe meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured\\nout the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that\\nwere before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to eat and\\ndrink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their\\nplaces in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and\\nunder the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came\\nafter them with a golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they\\nmight make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front\\nof the horses and pledged them, saying, \"Farewell to both of you;\\nsee that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind\\nto me as any father could be while we Achaeans were fighting before\\nTroy.\" \\n\\n\"We will be sure, sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"to tell him everything\\nas soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses\\nreturned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very\\ngreat kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents\\nI am taking with me.\" \\n\\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand- an eagle with\\na great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the\\nfarm yard- and all the men and women were running after it and shouting.\\nIt came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands\\nin front of the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their\\nhearts took comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, \"Tell me,\\nMenelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for you?\" \\n\\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him\\nto make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, \"I will read this\\nmatter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it\\nwill come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred\\nand has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled\\nfar and suffered much, will return to take his revenge- if indeed\\nhe is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors.\"\\n\\n\"May Jove so grant it,\" replied Telemachus; \"if it should prove to\\nbe so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when\\nI am at home.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed\\nthrough the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon\\ntheir necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and\\ndarkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles\\nlived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they passed\\nthe night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning,\\nrosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their\\nplaces in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and\\nunder the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed\\nhis horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came\\nto Pylos, and then Telemachus said: \\n\\n\"Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask\\nyou. You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we\\nare both of an age, and this journey has brought us together still\\nmore closely; do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me\\nthere, for if I go to your father\\'s house he will try to keep me in\\nthe warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go home at once.\"\\n\\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end\\nhe deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus\\'s\\nbeautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel.\\nThen he said, \"Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also\\nbefore I can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he\\nis, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to\\nfetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he will be very\\nangry.\" \\n\\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians\\nand soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together\\nand gave his orders. \"Now, my men,\" said he, \"get everything in order\\non board the ship, and let us set out home.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But\\nas Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva\\nin the ship\\'s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country,\\na seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He\\nwas descended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of\\nsheep; he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into\\nexile by the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods\\nand held them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner\\nin the house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on\\naccount of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a\\ngreat sorrow that dread Erinyes had laid upon him. In the end, however,\\nhe escaped with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos,\\navenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of\\nNeleus to his brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos,\\nwhere it was ordained that he should reign over much people. There\\nhe married, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates\\nand Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus,\\nwho was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live\\nto old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman\\'s gifts.\\nHis sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of\\nMelampus, was father to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in\\ngold, carried off Cleitus for his beauty\\'s sake, that he might dwell\\namong the immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer\\nin the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with\\nhis father and went to live in Hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied\\nfor all men. \\n\\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he\\nwas making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. \"Friend\\'\" said\\nhe, \"now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you\\nby your sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them,\\nI pray you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell\\nme the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell\\nme also of your town and parents.\" \\n\\nTelemachus said, \"I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca,\\nand my father is \\'Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he\\nhas come to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and\\ngot my crew together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he\\nhas been away a long time.\" \\n\\n\"I too,\" answered Theoclymenus, am an exile, for I have killed a man\\nof my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they\\nhave great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at\\ntheir hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the\\nearth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship\\nthat they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit.\"\\n\\n\"I will not refuse you,\" replied Telemachus, \"if you wish to join\\nus. Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according\\nto what we have.\" \\n\\nOn this he received Theoclymenus\\' spear and laid it down on the deck\\nof the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus\\nsit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them\\nto catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They\\nset the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made\\nit fast with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with\\nsheets of twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew\\nfresh and strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible.\\nThus then they passed by Crouni and Chalcis. \\n\\nPresently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel\\nmade a quick pass sage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the Epeans\\nrule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands, wondering\\nwithin himself whether he should escape death or should be taken prisoner.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the\\nhut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat\\nand drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether\\nhe would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the\\nstation or pack him off to the city; so he said: \\n\\n\"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging\\nabout the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men.\\nGive me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go\\nwith me and show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging\\nas I needs must, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece\\nof bread. I should like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring\\nnews of her husband to queen Penelope. I could then go about among\\nthe suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give me\\na dinner. I should soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts\\nof ways. Listen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing of\\nMercury who gives grace and good name to the works of all men, there\\nis no one living who would make a more handy servant than I should-\\nto put fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine,\\nand do all those services that poor men have to do for their betters.\"\\n\\nThe swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. \"Heaven\\nhelp me,\" he exclaimed, \"what ever can have put such a notion as that\\ninto your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a\\ncertainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They\\nwould never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their servants\\nare all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and shirts, with\\nwell looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept\\nquite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay where\\nyou are, then; you are not in anybody\\'s way; I do not mind your being\\nhere, no more do any of the others, and when Telemachus comes home\\nhe will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you\\nwant to go.\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are\\nto me, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble;\\nthere is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp; still,\\nwhen men have once got low down in the world they will go through\\na great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since however you\\npress me to stay here and await the return of Telemachus, tell about\\nUlysses\\' mother, and his father whom he left on the threshold of old\\nage when he set out for Troy. Are they still living or are they already\\ndead and in the house of Hades?\" \\n\\n\"I will tell you all about them,\" replied Eumaeus, \"Laertes is still\\nliving and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully his own house,\\nfor he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also\\nabout the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him\\nmore than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end through sorrow\\nfor her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me\\ncome to such an end as she did. As long as she was still living, though\\nshe was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking her\\nhow she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene,\\nthe youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and she\\nmade little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up,\\nthey sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As\\nfor me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of\\nsandals for my feet, and sent me off into the country, but she was\\njust as fond of me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased\\nheaven to prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have\\nenough to eat and drink, and can find something for any respectable\\nstranger who comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or deed\\nout of my mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked\\npeople. Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk\\nwith her; they like to have something to eat and drink at the house,\\nand something too to take back with them into the country. This is\\nwhat will keep servants in a good humour.\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Then you must have been a very little fellow, Eumaeus,\\nwhen you were taken so far away from your home and parents. Tell me,\\nand tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother lived\\nsacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you were\\nalone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for\\nwhatever your master gave them?\" \\n\\n\"Stranger,\" replied Eumaeus, \"as regards your question: sit still,\\nmake yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The\\nnights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for\\nsleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed\\ntill bed time, too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one\\nof the others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can\\nthen take my master\\'s pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning.\\nWe two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one\\nanother stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered\\nmuch, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling\\nthe memory of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question,\\nthen, my tale is as follows: \\n\\n\"You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above\\nOrtygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in another direction.\\nIt is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good, with much pasture\\nfit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat. Dearth\\nnever comes there, nor are the people plagued by any sickness, but\\nwhen they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them with his\\npainless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole country\\nis divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a\\nman comparable to the gods, reigned over both. \\n\\n\"Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia\\n(for the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had\\nfreighted with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician\\nwoman in my father\\'s house, very tall and comely, and an excellent\\nservant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing\\nnear their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman\\ncan resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had\\nseduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on\\nthis she told him her father\\'s name. \\'I come from Sidon,\\' said she,\\n\\'and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I\\nwas coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates seized\\nme and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man who\\nowns this house, and he gave them their price for me.\\' \\n\\n\"The man who had seduced her then said, \\'Would you like to come along\\nwith us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?\\nThey are both alive and are said to be well off.\\' \\n\\n\"\\'I will do so gladly,\\' answered she, \\'if you men will first swear\\nme a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.\\'\\n\\n\"They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their\\noath the woman said, \\'Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the\\nstreet or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one\\nshould go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something.\\nHe would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep\\nyour own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can,\\nand send me word when you have done loading. I will bring as much\\ngold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else also that\\nI can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good\\nman of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I\\nwill carry him off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of\\nmoney for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.\\'\\n\\n\"On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole\\nyear till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,\\nand then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the\\nwoman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father\\'s\\nhouse bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it;\\nand while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring\\nit and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and\\nthen went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led\\nme out of the house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables\\nset with the cups of guests who had been feasting with my father,\\nas being in attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting\\nof the public assembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried\\nthem off in the bosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew\\nno better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over all the land,\\nso we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,\\nwhere the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they\\nsailed their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent\\nthen a fair wind; six days did we sail both night and day, but on\\nthe seventh day Diana struck the woman and she fell heavily down into\\nthe ship\\'s hold as though she were a sea gull alighting on the water;\\nso they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes, and I was left\\nall sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds and waves took the ship\\nto Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and thus\\nit was that ever I came to set eyes upon this country.\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes\\nwith the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good\\nas well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master,\\nwho sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead\\na good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city\\nto city.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left\\nfor sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the meantime Telemachus and\\nhis crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the\\nmast, and rowed the ship into the harbour. They cast out their mooring\\nstones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,\\nmixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough\\nto eat and drink Telemachus said, \"Take the ship on to the town, but\\nleave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my\\nfarms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down\\nto the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will\\ngive you all a good dinner with meat and wine.\" \\n\\nThen Theoclymenus said, \\'And what, my dear young friend, is to become\\nof me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or\\nshall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?\"\\n\\n\"At any other time,\" replied Telemachus, \"I should have bidden you\\ngo to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at\\nthe present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for\\nI shall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often\\nshow herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in\\nan upper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose\\nhouse you can go to- I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is\\nheld in the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much\\nthe best man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying\\ncourt to my mother and trying to take Ulysses\\' place. Jove, however,\\nin heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end before\\nthe marriage takes place.\" \\n\\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand- a hawk, Apollo\\'s\\nmessenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore\\nthem off, fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship.\\nOn this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.\\n\"Telemachus,\" said he, \"that bird did not fly on your right hand without\\nhaving been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it\\nwas an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there\\nwill be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.\" \\n\\n\"I wish it may prove so,\" answered Telemachus. \"If it does, I will\\nshow you so much good will and give you so many presents that all\\nwho meet you will congratulate you.\" \\n\\nThen he said to his friend Piraeus, \"Piraeus, son of Clytius, you\\nhave throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all\\nthose who have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this\\nstranger to your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can\\ncome for him.\" \\n\\nAnd Piraeus answered, \"Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you\\nplease, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack\\nof hospitality.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose\\nthe hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus\\nbound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head\\nof sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the\\nhawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city\\nas they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as\\nhe could, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds\\nof swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who\\nwas so devoted a servant to his master. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XVI\\n\\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and\\nwere were getting breakfast ready at daybreak for they had sent the\\nmen out with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark,\\nbut fawned upon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing\\nthat the dogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus: \\n\\n\"Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one\\nof your acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning urn\\nhim and not barking.\" \\n\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the\\ndoor. Eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing\\nwine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed\\nhis head and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could\\nnot be more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his\\nold age, after ten years\\' absence in a foreign country and after having\\ngone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as\\nthough he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:\\n\\n\"So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When\\nI heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see\\nyou any more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have\\na good look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you\\ncome into the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to\\nthe town generally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on\\nwhat the suitors are doing.\" \\n\\n\"So be it, old friend,\" answered Telemachus, \"but I am come now because\\nI want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her\\nold home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed\\nof Ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.\"\\n\\n\"She is still at the house,\" replied Eumaeus, \"grieving and breaking\\nher heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually.\"\\n\\nAs spoke he took Telemachus\\' spear, whereon he crossed the stone threshold\\nand came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place as he\\nentered, but Telemachus checked him; \"Sit down, stranger.\" said he,\\n\"I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay\\nit for me.\" \\n\\nUlysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green\\nbrushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemachus\\nto sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat,\\nthe remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled\\nthe bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine also\\nin bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they\\nlaid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as\\nsoon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,\\n\"Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew\\nbring him to Ithaca, and who were they?-for assuredly he did not come\\nhere by land\"\\' \\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"My son, I will tell you\\nthe real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great\\ntraveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,\\nand has refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands. Do\\nwhatever you like with him, only remember that he is your suppliant.\"\\n\\n\"I am very much distressed,\" said Telemachus, \"by what you have just\\ntold me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young,\\nand am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My\\nmother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look\\nafter the house out of respect for public opinion and the memory of\\nher husband, or whether the time is now come for her to take the best\\nman of those who are wooing her, and the one who will make her the\\nmost advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to your station\\nI will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals,\\nand will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can\\nkeep him here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food\\nthat he may be no burden on you and on your men; but I will not have\\nhim go near the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure\\nto ill-treat him in a way that would greatly grieve me; no matter\\nhow valiant a man may be he can do nothing against numbers, for they\\nwill be too strong for him.\" \\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, it is right that I should say something myself.\\nI am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way\\nin which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you\\nare. Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some\\ngod set your people against you? May you not complain of your brothers-\\nfor it is to these that a man may look for support, however great\\nhis quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my present\\nmind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would\\nrather some one came and cut my head off, but I would go to the house\\nand be the bane of every one of these men. If they were too many for\\nme- I being single-handed- I would rather die fighting in my own house\\nthan see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly\\nmaltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in\\nan unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no\\npurpose for an end that shall never be accomplished.\" \\n\\nAnd Telemachus answered, \"I will tell you truly everything. There\\nis no emnity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers,\\nto whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be.\\nJove has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of\\nArceisius, and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son\\nof Ulysses who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have\\nnever been of any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the\\nhands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring\\nislands, Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men\\nof Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying\\ncourt to my mother, who will neither say point blank that she will\\nnot marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, so they are making havoc\\nof my estate, and before long will do so with myself into the bargain.\\nThe issue, however, rests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus,\\ngo at once and tell Penelope that I am safe and have returned from\\nPylos. Tell it to herself alone, and then come back here without letting\\nany one else know, for there are many who are plotting mischief against\\nme.\" \\n\\n\"I understand and heed you,\" replied Eumaeus; \"you need instruct me\\nno further, only I am going that way say whether I had not better\\nlet poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend\\nthe work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses,\\nand he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they\\ntell me that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither\\neaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm,\\nbut sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.\"\\n\\n\"More\\'s the pity,\" answered Telemachus, \"I am sorry for him, but we\\nmust leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything\\ntheir own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return\\nof my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back\\nagain, and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother\\nto send one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him\\nhear it from her.\" \\n\\nThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,\\nbound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched\\nhim well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a\\nwoman- fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the\\nentry, and revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see\\nher, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves\\nbe seen by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs, for they\\ndid not bark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of\\nthe yards. She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows;\\nwhereon he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall\\nof the yards. Then she said to him: \\n\\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your\\nson: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for\\nthe destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will\\nnot be long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw\\na fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him\\nyounger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,\\nfilled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she\\nwent away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded\\nwhen he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking\\nupon a god. \\n\\n\"Stranger,\" said he, \"how suddenly you have changed from what you\\nwere a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour\\nis not the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in\\nheaven? If so, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice\\nand offerings of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.\" \\n\\nAnd Ulysses said, \"I am no god, why should you take me for one? I\\nam your father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at\\nthe hands of lawless men.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to\\nthe ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. but Telemachus\\ncould not yet believe that it was his father, and said: \\n\\n\"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes\\nthat I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself\\ncontrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young\\nat a moment\\'s notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you\\nwere old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down\\nfrom heaven.\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably\\nastonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who\\nwill come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering\\nand much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.\\nWhat you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva,\\nwho does with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases.\\nAt one moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young\\nman with good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods\\nwho live in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father\\nand wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like\\neagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their\\nhalf fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and\\nthe sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had\\nnot suddenly said, \"In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring\\nyou to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be- for\\nyou cannot have come by land?\" \\n\\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" replied Ulysses. \"It was the\\nPhaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in\\nthe habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They\\ntook me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca,\\nafter giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These\\nthings by heaven\\'s mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now\\ncome here on the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing\\nour enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with\\ntheir number, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can\\nthen turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether we two can fight\\nthe whole body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to\\nhelp us.\" \\n\\nTo this Telemachus answered, \"Father, I have always heard of your\\nrenown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of\\nis a very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men\\ncannot stand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors\\nonly, nor twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their\\nnumber at once. There are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium,\\nand they have six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty\\nyoung Achaeans from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all\\nof them well born. They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and\\ntwo men who can carve at table. If we face such numbers as this, you\\nmay have bitter cause to rue your coming, and your revenge. See whether\\nyou cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and help\\nus.\" \\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" replied Ulysses, \"and think whether Minerva and her\\nfather Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some\\none else as well.\" \\n\\n\"Those whom you have named,\" answered Telemachus, \"are a couple of\\ngood allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have\\npower over both gods and men.\" \\n\\n\"These two,\" continued Ulysses, \"will not keep long out of the fray,\\nwhen the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return\\nhome early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before.\\nLater on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable\\nold beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel your heart against\\nmy sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of the house,\\nor throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently trying\\nto make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to you,\\nfor the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and\\nlay my saying to your heart, when Minerva shall put it in my mind,\\nI will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect\\nall the armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store\\nroom. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing\\nit; say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke,\\ninasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but\\nhas become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly\\nthat you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine,\\nand that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both\\nbanquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people\\nto use them. But leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and\\nme, and a couple oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any\\nmoment; Jove and Minerva will then soon quiet these people. There\\nis also another matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs\\nin your veins, let no one know that Ulysses is within the house- neither\\nLaertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even\\nPenelope herself. Let you and me exploit the women alone, and let\\nus also make trial of some other of the men servants, to see who is\\non our side and whose hand is against us.\" \\n\\n\"Father,\" replied Telemachus, \"you will come to know me by and by,\\nand when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not\\nthink, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either\\nof us. Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round\\nof the farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will\\nbe wasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove\\nthe women by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless,\\nbut I am not in favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend\\nto that later on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will\\nsupport you.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought Telemachus\\nand his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When they\\nhad come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land; their\\nservants came and took their armour from them, and they left all the\\npresents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell\\nPenelope that Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the\\nship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.\\nThis servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the\\nsame errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House,\\nthe servant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the\\nwaiting women, \"Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos\"; but\\nEumaeus went close up to Penelope, and said privately that her son\\nhad given bidden him tell her. When he had given his message he left\\nthe house with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs again.\\n\\nThe suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they\\nwent outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held\\na council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was\\nthe first to speak. \\n\\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"this voyage of Telemachus\\'s is a very serious\\nmatter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however,\\nlet us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send\\nafter the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.\"\\n\\nHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and\\nsaw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails,\\nand putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others,\\n\"We need not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must\\nhave told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake\\nher. \\n\\nOn this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the\\nship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they\\nwent up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let\\nany one old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes,\\nspoke first. \\n\\n\"Good heavens,\" said he, \"see how the gods have saved this man from\\ndestruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all\\nday long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep,\\nbut waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing\\nand killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us.\\nLet us consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape\\nus; our affair is never likely to come off while is alive, for he\\nis very shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our side.\\nWe must make haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he\\nwill lose no time in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and\\nwill tell all the world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to\\ntake him. The people will not like this when they come to know of\\nit; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from our own\\ncountry into exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either on his farm\\naway from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can divide up his\\nproperty amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marries her\\nhave the house. If this does not please you, and you wish Telemachus\\nto live on and hold his father\\'s property, then we must not gather\\nhere and eat up his goods in this way, but must make our offers to\\nPenelope each from his own house, and she can marry the man who will\\ngive the most for her, and whose lot it is to win her.\" \\n\\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the\\nson of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among\\nall the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of\\nDulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope\\nthan that of any of the other for he was a man of good natural disposition.\\n\"My friends,\" said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly,\\n\"I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous thing to\\nkill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods,\\nand if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to kill him\\nmyself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade\\nus, I would have you hold your hands.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith\\nand went to the house of Ulysses where they took their accustomed\\nseats. \\n\\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors.\\nShe knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had\\noverheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore\\nto the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors\\nshe stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister\\nholding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:\\n\\n\"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best\\nspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you\\nare nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the\\ndeath of Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness\\nis Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one\\nanother. Do you not remember how your father fled to this house in\\nfear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gone with\\nsome Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace\\nwith us? They wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he\\nhad, but Ulysses stayed their hands although they were infuriated,\\nand now you devour his property without paying for it, and break my\\nheart by his wooing his wife and trying to kill his son. Leave off\\ndoing so, and stop the others also.\" \\n\\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, \"Take heart, Queen Penelope\\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters.\\nThe man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon\\nyour son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the\\nearth. I say- and it shall surely be- that my spear shall be reddened\\nwith his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees,\\nheld wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands.\\nTherefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing\\nto fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to\\nhim from the gods, he cannot escape it.\" He said this to quiet her,\\nbut in reality he was plotting against Telemachus. \\n\\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva\\nshed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses\\nand his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and\\nwere ready; helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore\\ncame up to Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her\\nwand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd\\nmight recognize him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.\\n\\nTelemachus was the first to speak. \"So you have got back, Eumaeus,\"\\nsaid he. \"What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned,\\nor are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?\"\\n\\n\"I did not think of asking about that,\" replied Eumaeus, \"when I was\\nin the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon\\nas I could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos,\\nand he was the first to tell the new your mother, but I can say what\\nI saw with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill\\nof Mercury above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with\\na number of men in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought\\nit was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.\" \\n\\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus\\ncould not see him. \\n\\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they\\nate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied.\\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to\\nrest and enjoyed the boon of sleep. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XVII\\n\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus\\nbound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands,\\nfor he wanted to go into the city. \"Old friend,\" said he to the swineherd,\\n\"I will now go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will\\nnever leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate\\nstranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who\\nwill give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough\\nof my own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes\\nhim angry so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can\\nalways do better in town than country, for any one who likes can give\\nhim something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck\\nand call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told\\nhim, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire,\\nand the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly\\nthin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you\\nsay the city is some way off.\" \\n\\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge\\nupon the When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing-post\\nof the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and\\nwent inside. \\n\\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting\\nthe fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up\\nto him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and\\nshoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking\\nlike Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son.\\nShe kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, \"Light of my\\neyes,\" she cried as she spoke fondly to him, \"so you are come home\\nagain; I made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think\\nof your having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it\\nor obtaining my consent. But come, tell me what you saw.\"\\n\\n\"Do not scold me, mother,\\' answered Telemachus, \"nor vex me, seeing\\nwhat a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress,\\ngo upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs\\nto all the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors.\\nI must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has\\ncome back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and told\\nPiraeus to take him home and look after him till I could come for\\nhim myself.\" \\n\\nShe heeded her son\\'s words, washed her face, changed her dress, and\\nvowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would\\nonly vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors. \\n\\nTelemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand-\\nnot alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him\\nwith a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him\\nas he went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words\\nin their mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and\\nwent to sit with Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of\\nhis father\\'s house, and they made him tell them all that had happened\\nto him. Then Piraeus came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted\\nthrough the town to the place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once\\njoined them. Piraeus was first to speak: \"Telemachus,\" said he, \"I\\nwish you would send some of your women to my house to take awa the\\npresents Menelaus gave you.\" \\n\\n\"We do not know, Piraeus,\" answered Telemachus, \"what may happen.\\nIf the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among\\nthem, I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people\\nshould get hold of them. If on the other hand I manage to kill them,\\nI shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.\"\\n\\nWith these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they\\ngot there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into\\nthe baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed\\nthem, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats\\nat table. A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden\\newer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands;\\nand she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them\\nbread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.\\nOpposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the bearing-posts\\nof the cloister, and spinning. Then they laid their hands on the good\\nthings that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to\\neat and drink Penelope said: \\n\\n\"Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which\\nI have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set\\nout for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make\\nit clear to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether\\nor no you had been able to hear anything about the return of your\\nfather.\" \\n\\n\"I will tell you then truth,\" replied her son. \"We went to Pylos and\\nsaw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably\\nas though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long\\nabsence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word\\nfrom any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead.\\nHe sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There\\nI saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were\\nin heaven\\'s wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was\\nthat had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth,\\nwhereon he said, \\'So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man\\'s\\nbed? A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a\\nlion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell.\\nThe lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with\\nthe pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father\\nJove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was\\nwhen he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily\\nthat all the Greeks cheered him- if he is still such, and were to\\ncome near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry\\nwedding. As regards your question, however, I will not prevaricate\\nnor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much\\nwill I tell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on an island\\nsorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was keeping\\nhim prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no ships\\nnor sailors to take him over the sea.\\' This was what Menelaus told\\nme, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave\\nme a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.\" \\n\\nWith these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus\\nsaid to her: \\n\\n\"Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things;\\nlisten therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide\\nnothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the\\nrites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come,\\nthat Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about\\nthe country or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil\\ndeeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen\\nwhen I was on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about\\nit.\" \\n\\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true,\\nyou shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who\\nsee you shall congratulate you.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs,\\nor aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of\\nthe house, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it\\nwas now time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come\\ninto the town from all the country round, with their shepherds as\\nusual, then Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited\\nupon them at table, said, \"Now then, my young masters, you have had\\nenough sport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner\\nis not a bad thing, at dinner time.\" \\n\\nThey left their sports as he told them, and when they were within\\nthe house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside,\\nand then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of\\nthem fat and well grown. Thus they made ready for their meal. In the\\nmeantime Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town,\\nand the swineherd said, \"Stranger, I suppose you still want to go\\nto town to-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part\\nI should have liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must\\ndo as my master tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding\\nfrom one\\'s master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for\\nit is now broad day; it will be night again directly and then you\\nwill find it colder.\" \\n\\n\"I know, and understand you,\" replied Ulysses; \"you need say no more.\\nLet us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it\\nto walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,\\nby the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his\\nliking. The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the\\ndogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and\\nhis master followed after, looking like some broken-down old tramp\\nas he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When\\nthey had got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city,\\nthey reached the fountain from which the citizens drew their water.\\nThis had been made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a\\ngrove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and\\nthe clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, while above\\nthe fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers\\nused to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as\\nhe was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors\\'\\ndinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus\\nand Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language,\\nwhich made Ulysses very angry. \\n\\n\"There you go,\" cried he, \"and a precious pair you are. See how heaven\\nbrings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master\\nswineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make\\nany one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never\\nwon a prize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his\\nshoulders against every man\\'s door post, and begging, not for swords\\nand cauldrons like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth begging\\nfor. If you would give him to me for a hand on my station, he might\\ndo to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids,\\nand he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but\\nhe has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he\\nwill do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, to feed his insatiable\\nbelly. I say, therefore and it shall surely be- if he goes near Ulysses\\'\\nhouse he will get his head broken by the stools they will fling at\\nhim, till they turn him out.\" \\n\\nOn this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure\\nwantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path.\\nFor a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill\\nhim with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains\\nout; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check,\\nbut the swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting\\nup his hands and praying to heaven as he did so. \\n\\n\"Fountain nymphs,\" he cried, \"children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned\\nyou thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my\\nprayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to\\nthe swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting\\npeople-gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin\\nthrough bad shepherding.\" \\n\\nThen Melanthius the goatherd answered, \"You ill-conditioned cur, what\\nare you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship\\nand take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket\\nthe money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would\\nstrike Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill\\nhim, as I am that Ulysses will never come home again.\" \\n\\nWith this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went\\nquickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he\\ngot there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite\\nEurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. The servants\\nbrought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread\\nbefore him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd\\ncame up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius\\nwas just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold\\nof the swineherd\\'s hand, and said: \\n\\n\"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how\\nfar you go you will find few like it. One building keeps following\\non after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all\\nround it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it\\nwould be a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too,\\nthat there are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell\\nof roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods have made\\nto go along with feasting.\" \\n\\nThen Eumaeus said, \"You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally\\ndo; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside\\nfirst and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you\\nwait here and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one\\nmay you loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider\\nthis matter I pray you.\" \\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I understand and heed. Go in first and leave\\nme here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things\\nthrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea\\nthat I am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a\\nman cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy\\nwhich gives much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships\\nare fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other people.\"\\n\\nAs they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised\\nhis head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had\\nbred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out\\nof him. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when\\nthey went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his\\nmaster was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow\\ndung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come\\nand draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas.\\nAs soon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and\\nwagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When\\nUlysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from\\nhis eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and said: \\n\\n\"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:\\nhis build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he\\nonly one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept\\nmerely for show?\" \\n\\n\"This hound,\" answered Eumaeus, \"belonged to him who has died in a\\nfar country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he\\nwould soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in\\nthe forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks.\\nBut now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone,\\nand the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when\\ntheir master\\'s hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes half the\\ngoodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the\\nsuitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.\\n\\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned\\nhim to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat\\nlying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the\\nsuitors; he picked it up, brought it to Telemachus\\'s table, and sat\\ndown opposite him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave\\nhim bread from the bread-basket. \\n\\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor miserable\\nold beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags.\\nHe sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading\\nfrom the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood\\nwhich the carpenter had skillfully planed, and had made to join truly\\nwith rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the bread-basket,\\nwith as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and said to Eumaeus,\\n\"Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of the suitors,\\nand beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced.\" \\n\\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, \"Stranger, Telemachus sends you\\nthis, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for\\nbeggars must not be shamefaced.\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus,\\nand fulfil the desire of his heart.\" \\n\\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid\\nit on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while\\nthe bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left\\noff. The suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses\\nand prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors,\\nthat he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good\\nfrom the bad; but come what might she was not going to save a single\\none of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left\\nto right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real\\nbeggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking\\none another who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd\\nMelanthius said, \"Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something\\nabout him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd brought him here,\\nbut I know nothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from.\"\\n\\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. \"You precious idiot,\"\\nhe cried, \"what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not\\ntramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?\\nDo you think it a small thing that such people gather here to waste\\nyour master\\'s property and must you needs bring this man as well?\"\\n\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Antinous, your birth is good but your words\\nevil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to\\ninvite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those\\nwho can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter,\\nor a bard who can charm us with his Such men are welcome all the world\\nover, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him.\\nYou are always harder on Ulysses\\' servants than any of the other suitors\\nare, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as Telemachus\\nand Penelope are alive and here.\" \\n\\nBut Telemachus said, \"Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the bitterest\\ntongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.\"\\n\\nThen turning to Antinous he said, \"Antinous, you take as much care\\nof my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to\\nsee this stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take\\' something\\nand give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never\\nmind my mother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I\\nknow you will not do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things\\nyourself than of giving them to other people.\" \\n\\n\"What do you mean, Telemachus,\" replied Antinous, \"by this swaggering\\ntalk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would\\nnot come here again for another three months.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from\\nunder the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses,\\nbut the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet\\nwith bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold\\nand eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to Antinous\\nand said: \\n\\n\"Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here;\\nyou seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should\\nbe the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty.\\nI too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those\\ndays I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might\\nbe nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other\\nthings which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy,\\nbut it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band\\nof roving robbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone\\nby it. I stationed my bade ships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my\\nmen stay by them and keep guard over them, while sent out scouts to\\nreconnoitre from every point of vantage. \\n\\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives\\nand children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and\\nwhen they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till\\nthe plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam\\nof armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no\\nlonger face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians\\nkilled many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for\\nthem; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them, to take\\nto Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man in Cyprus.\\nThence I am come hither in a state of great misery.\" \\n\\nThen Antinous said, \"What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague\\nus during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court, or\\nI will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and\\nimportunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given\\nyou lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to\\nbe free with other people\\'s property when there is plenty of it.\"\\n\\nOn this Ulysses began to move off, and said, \"Your looks, my fine\\nsir, are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house\\nyou would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though\\nyou are in another man\\'s, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot\\nfind it in you to give him even a piece of bread.\" \\n\\nThis made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, \"You\\nshall pay for this before you get clear of the court.\" With these\\nwords he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder-blade\\nnear the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow\\ndid not even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded\\non his revenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there,\\nlaying his well-filled wallet at his feet. \\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" he cried, \"you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may\\nspeak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he\\ngets hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle;\\nand even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable\\nbelly, which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the\\npoor have gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous\\nmay come to a bad end before his marriage.\" \\n\\n\"Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off elsewhere,\"\\nshouted Antinous. \"If you say more I will have you dragged hand and\\nfoot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you alive.\"\\n\\nThe other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young\\nmen said, \"Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a\\ntramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god-\\nand we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people\\nfrom foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who do amiss\\nand who righteously.\" \\n\\nThus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile Telemachus\\nwas furious about the blow that had been given to his father, and\\nthough no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence and brooded\\non his revenge. \\n\\nNow when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the banqueting-cloister,\\nshe said before her maids, \"Would that Apollo would so strike you,\\nAntinous,\" and her waiting woman Eurynome answered, \"If our prayers\\nwere answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the sun\\nrise.\" Then Penelope said, \"Nurse, I hate every single one of them,\\nfor they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinous like the darkness\\nof death itself. A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about the\\nhouse for sheer want. Every one else has given him something to put\\nin his wallet, but Antinous has hit him on the right shoulder-blade\\nwith a footstool.\" \\n\\nThus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in\\nthe meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the\\nswineherd and said, \"Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here,\\nI want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled\\nmuch, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"If these Achaeans, Madam,\\nwould only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his\\nadventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,\\nwhich was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,\\nand he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had\\nbeen the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose\\nlips all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed\\nas I sat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship\\nbetween his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete\\nwhere the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither\\nand thither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he\\nhas heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians,\\nand that he is bringing great wealth home with him.\" \\n\\n\"Call him here, then,\" said Penelope, \"that I too may hear his story.\\nAs for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as\\nthey will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine\\nremain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume\\nthem, while they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing\\nour oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving\\nso much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate\\ncan stand such recklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect\\nus. If he were to come again, he and his son would soon have their\\nrevenge.\" \\n\\nAs she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded\\nwith it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaeus,\\n\"Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just\\nas I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are going\\nto be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore I\\nsay, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger\\nis speaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear.\"\\n\\nWhen Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, \"Father\\nstranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for\\nyou; she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can\\ntell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking\\nthe truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very\\nthings that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough\\nof that to fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting\\nthose give that will.\" \\n\\n\"I will tell Penelope,\" answered Ulysses, \"nothing but what is strictly\\ntrue. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him\\nin affliction, but I am afraid of passing. through this crowd of cruel\\nsuitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now, moreover,\\nas I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man gave\\nme a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any one\\nelse defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait\\ntill sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my\\nclothes are worn very thin- you know they are, for you have seen them\\never since I first asked you to help me- she can then ask me about\\nthe return of her husband.\" \\n\\nThe swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she\\nsaw him cross the threshold, \"Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus?\\nIs he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming\\ninside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"The stranger is quite\\nreasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any\\none else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be\\nmuch better, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when\\nyou can hear him and talk to him as you will.\" \\n\\n\"The man is no fool,\" answered Penelope, \"it would very likely be\\nas he says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world\\nas these men are.\" \\n\\nWhen she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he\\nhad explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in\\nhis ear so that none could overhear him, \"My dear sir, I will now\\ngo back to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business.\\nYou will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful to\\nkeep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May\\nJove bring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" replied Telemachus, \"go home when you have had your dinner,\\nand in the morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice\\nfor the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.\" \\n\\nOn this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his\\ndinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table,\\nand went back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began\\nto amuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting\\non towards evening. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XVIII\\n\\nNow there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all\\nover the city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton\\nand drunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he was\\na great hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother\\ngave him, was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called him Irus,\\nbecause he used to run errands for any one who would send him. As\\nsoon as he came he began to insult Ulysses, and to try and drive him\\nout of his own house. \\n\\n\"Be off, old man,\" he cried, \"from the doorway, or you shall be dragged\\nout neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me the\\nwink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like\\nto do so? Get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to blows.\"\\n\\nUlysses frowned on him and said, \"My friend, I do you no manner of\\nharm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is\\nroom enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge\\nme things that are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another\\ntramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by\\nand by. Do not, however, talk too much about fighting or you will\\nincense me, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest\\nwith blood. I shall have more peace to-morrow if I do, for you will\\nnot come to the house of Ulysses any more.\" \\n\\nIrus was very angry and answered, \"You filthy glutton, you run on\\ntrippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands\\nabout you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar\\'s\\ntusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and\\nlook on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much younger\\nthan yourself.\" \\n\\nThus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front\\nof the doorway, and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed\\nheartily and said to the others, \"This is the finest sport that you\\never saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house.\\nThe stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight, let us\\nset them on to do so at once.\" \\n\\nThe suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged\\ntramps. \"Listen to me,\" said Antinous, \"there are some goats\\' paunches\\ndown at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set\\naside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the\\nbetter man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our\\ntable and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all.\"\\n\\nThe others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent, said,\\n\"Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold\\nhis own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on,\\nthough I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear,\\nhowever that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour Irus and\\nsecure him the victory.\" \\n\\nThey swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath\\nTelemachus put in a word and said, \"Stranger, if you have a mind to\\nsettle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever\\nstrikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and the other\\nchiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of understanding,\\nare of the same mind as I am.\" \\n\\nEvery one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,\\nthus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and\\nhis mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even\\nstronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one\\nwould turn towards his neighbour saying, \"The stranger has brought\\nsuch a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left\\nof Irus.\" \\n\\nIrus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded\\nhim by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court] in\\nsuch a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded\\nhim and said, \"You swaggering bully, you ought never to have been\\nborn at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creature\\nas this tramp is. I say, therefore- and it shall surely be- if he\\nbeats you and proves himself the better man, I shall pack you off\\non board ship to the mainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills\\nevery one that comes near him. He will cut off your nose and ears,\\nand draw out your entrails for the dogs to eat.\" \\n\\nThis frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the middle\\nof the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then Ulysses\\nconsidered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an\\nend of him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter\\nblow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best\\nto give the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect\\nwho he was. Then they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the\\nright shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the\\near that broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came gushing\\nout of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth\\nand kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and\\nnearly died of laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by the foot\\nand dragged him into the outer court as far as the gate-house. There\\nhe propped him up against the wall and put his staff in his hands.\\n\"Sit here,\" said he, \"and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful\\ncreature, and if you try to make yourself king of the beggars any\\nmore you shall fare still worse.\" \\n\\nThen he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, over his\\nshoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down\\nupon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing\\nand saluting him, \"May Jove, and all the other gods,\" said they, \\'grant\\nyou whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of\\nthis insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently,\\nto king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him.\"\\n\\nUlysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat\\'s\\npaunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves\\nout of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he\\ndid so in a golden goblet of wine. \"Good luck to you,\" he said, \"father\\nstranger, you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have\\nbetter times by and by.\" \\n\\nTo this Ulysses answered, \"Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of good\\nunderstanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are.\\nI have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium,\\na man both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you\\nappear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed\\nto what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have\\ntheir being upon earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and\\nstrength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even\\nwhen the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs\\nmust, and makes the best of it; for God Almighty gives men their daily\\nminds day by day. I know all about it, for I was a rich man once,\\nand did much wrong in the stubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence\\nthat my father and my brothers would support me; therefore let a man\\nfear God in all things always, and take the good that heaven may see\\nfit to send him without vainglory. Consider the infamy of what these\\nsuitors are doing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing\\ndishonour to the wife, of one who is certain to return some day, and\\nthat, too, not long hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send\\nyou home quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of\\nhis coming, for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly.\"\\n\\nWith these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he\\nput the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked away\\nserious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he\\ndid not escape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him fall by the\\nhand of Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from which\\nhe had come. \\n\\nThen Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the\\nsuitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and\\nwin still further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned\\na mocking laugh and said, \"Eurynome, I have changed my and have a\\nfancy to show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should\\nlike also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything\\nmore to do with them. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief.\"\\n\\n\"My dear child,\" answered Eurynome, \"all that you have said is true,\\ngo and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint\\nyour face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears;\\nit is not right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus,\\nwhom you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is\\nalready grown up.\" \\n\\n\"I know, Eurynome,\" replied Penelope, \"that you mean well, but do\\nnot try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed\\nme of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell\\nAutonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when\\nI am in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it would\\nnot be proper for me to do so.\" \\n\\nOn this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go to\\ntheir mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another matter,\\nand sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her\\ncouch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed\\ngrace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her.\\nShe washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears\\nwhen she goes dancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of\\na more commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter\\nthan sawn ivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away, whereon\\nthe maids came in from the women\\'s room and woke Penelope with the\\nsound of their talking. \\n\\n\"What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,\" said she,\\nas she passed her hands over her face, \"in spite of all my misery.\\nI wish Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment,\\nthat I might no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband,\\nwho possessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished\\nman among the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nWith these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but\\nattended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she\\nstood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,\\nholding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either\\nside of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and\\nbecame so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might\\nwin her for his own bed fellow. \\n\\n\"Telemachus,\" said she, addressing her son, \"I fear you are no longer\\nso discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger\\nyou had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown\\nup, though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of\\na well-to-do father as far as size and good looks go, your conduct\\nis by no means what it should be. What is all this disturbance that\\nhas been going on, and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully\\nill-treated? What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury\\nwhile a suppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very discreditable\\nto you.\" \\n\\n\"I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,\" replied\\nTelemachus, \"I understand all about it and know when things are not\\nas they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,\\nhowever, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and\\nthen another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my\\nmind, and I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight\\nbetween Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant\\nit to do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,\\nMinerva, and Apollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers\\nof yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might\\nall be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court.\\nSee how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing\\nthat he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home, wherever\\nthat may be, for has no strength left in him.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, \"Queen Penelope,\\ndaughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could see\\nyou at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house\\nby tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole\\nworld both as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding.\"\\n\\nTo this Penelope replied, \"Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my\\nbeauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy\\nand my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after\\nmy affairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presence\\nto the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\\nwhich heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all,\\nand when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand- \\'Wife,\\n\\'he said, \\'we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the\\nTrojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent also\\nat fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight\\nsooner than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send\\nme back to you, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the\\nmeantime do you look after things here. Take care of my father and\\nmother as at present, and even more so during my absence, but when\\nyou see our son growing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave\\nthis your present home. This is what he said and now it is all coming\\ntrue. A night will come when I shall have to yield myself to a marriage\\nwhich I detest, for Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness.\\nThis further grief, moreover, cuts me to the very heart. You suitors\\nare not wooing me after the custom of my country. When men are courting\\na woman who they think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble\\nbirth, and when they are each trying to win her for himself, they\\nusually bring oxen and sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and\\nthey make her magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people\\'s\\nproperty without paying for it.\" \\n\\nThis was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying\\nto get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair\\nwords which he knew she did not mean. \\n\\nThen Antinous said, \"Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as\\nmany presents as you please from any one who will give them to you;\\nit is not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business\\nnor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among\\nus whoever he may be.\" \\n\\nThe others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his\\nservant to bring his present. Antinous\\'s man returned with a large\\nand lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully\\nmade brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus\\nimmediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads\\nthat gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas\\'s two men returned with some\\nearrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most\\nbeautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace\\nof the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful\\npresent of some kind. \\n\\nThen the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought\\nthe presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and\\ndancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it\\ngrew dark; they then brought in three braziers to give light, and\\npiled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torches\\nfrom them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses\\nsaid: \\n\\n\"Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the\\nqueen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick\\nwool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till\\nmorning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.\"\\n\\nThe maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho\\nbegan to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but\\nhad been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play\\nwith, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all\\nthis she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress,\\nand used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was\\nin love. \\n\\n\"Poor wretch,\" said she, \"are you gone clean out of your mind? Go\\nand sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering\\nhere. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters-\\nso many of them too? Has the wine been getting into your head, or\\ndo you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits\\nbecause you beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than\\nhe does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding\\nout of the house.\" \\n\\n\"Vixen,\" replied Ulysses, scowling at her, \"I will go and tell Telemachus\\nwhat you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb from limb.\"\\n\\nWith these words he scared the women, and they went off into the body\\nof the house. They trembled all aver, for they thought he would do\\nas he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers,\\nholding up torches and looking at the people- brooding the while on\\nthings that should surely come to pass. \\n\\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their insolence,\\nfor she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against them; she\\ntherefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him, which made\\nthe others laugh. \"Listen to me,\" said he, \"you suitors of Queen Penelope,\\nthat I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for nothing that this\\nman has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe the light has not\\nbeen coming from the torches, but from his own head- for his hair\\nis all gone, every bit of it.\" \\n\\nThen turning to Ulysses he said, \"Stranger, will you work as a servant,\\nif I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you\\nbuild a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year\\nround, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then?\\nNot you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not want to work;\\nyou had rather fill your belly by going round the country begging.\"\\n\\n\"Eurymachus,\" answered Ulysses, \"if you and I were to work one against\\nthe other in early summer when the days are at their longest- give\\nme a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which\\nwill fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when\\nthe mowing grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us\\neach take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and\\nendurance: turn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or\\nI can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out\\nthis day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting\\nwell upon my temples- you would find me foremost in the fray, and\\nwould cease your gibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel,\\nand think yourself a great man because you live in a little world,\\nind that a bad one. If Ulysses comes to his own again, the doors of\\nhis house are wide, but you will find them narrow when you try to\\nfly through them.\" \\n\\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, \"You\\nwretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me,\\nand in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do\\nyou always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because\\nyou beat the tramp Irus. With this he caught hold of a footstool,\\nbut Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium,\\nfor he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and\\nknocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and his\\nwine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered cloister\\nwere now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying,\\n\"I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck to hide, for\\nall the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such disturbance about\\na beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail we shall have no more\\npleasure at our banquet.\" \\n\\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, \"Sirs, are you mad? Can\\nyou not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit\\nhas possessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you\\nhave had your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.\"\\n\\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\\nbut Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, \"Do\\nnot let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer.\\nNeither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of Ulysses\\'\\nservants. Let the cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings, that\\nwe may make them and go home to our rest. As for the stranger, let\\nus leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to his house that\\nhe has come.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of\\nDulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water\\nand handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they made\\ntheir drink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had made\\ntheir drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded, they\\ntook their several ways each of them to his own abode. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XIX\\n\\nUlysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby\\nwith Minerva\\'s help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently\\nhe said to Telemachus, \"Telemachus, we must get the armour together\\nand take it down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you\\nwhy you have removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the\\nway of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses\\nwent away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this\\nmore particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel\\nover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may\\ndisgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes\\ntempts people to use them.\" \\n\\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse\\nEuryclea and said, \"Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while\\nI take the armour that my father left behind him down into the store\\nroom. No one looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got\\nall smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down\\nwhere the smoke cannot reach it.\" \\n\\n\"I wish, child,\" answered Euryclea, \"that you would take the management\\nof the house into your own hands altogether, and look after all the\\nproperty yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the\\nstore room? The maids would have so, but you would not let them.\\n\\n\"The stranger,\" said Telemachus, \"shall show me a light; when people\\neat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.\"\\n\\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room.\\nThen Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields,\\nand spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in\\nher hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus\\nsaid, \"Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the\\nrafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow\\nas with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come\\ndown from heaven.\" \\n\\n\"Hush,\" answered Ulysses, \"hold your peace and ask no questions, for\\nthis is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me\\nhere to talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief\\nwill ask me all sorts of questions.\" \\n\\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner\\ncourt, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed\\ntill morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering on\\nthe means whereby with Minerva\\'s help he might be able to kill the\\nsuitors. \\n\\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana,\\nand they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near\\nthe fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and\\nhad a footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was\\ncovered with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came\\nfrom the women\\'s room to join her. They set about removing the tables\\nat which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away the bread\\nthat was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied\\nthe embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to\\ngive both light and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a\\nsecond time and said, \"Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging\\nabout the house all night and spying upon the women? Be off, you wretch,\\noutside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven out with\\na firebrand.\" \\n\\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, \"My good woman, why should you\\nbe so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes\\nare all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after\\nthe manner of tramps and beggars generall? I too was a rich man once,\\nand had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp\\nsuch as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I\\nhad any number of servants, and all the other things which people\\nhave who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove\\nto take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come\\nto lose that pride and place in which you now wanton above your fellows;\\nhave a care lest you get out of favour with your mistress, and lest\\nUlysses should come home, for there is still a chance that he may\\ndo so. Moreover, though he be dead as you think he is, yet by Apollo\\'s\\nwill he has left a son behind him, Telemachus, who will note anything\\ndone amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no longer in his\\nboyhood.\" \\n\\nPenelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, \"Impudent\\nbaggage, said she, \"I see how abominably you are behaving, and you\\nshall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself,\\nthat I was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband,\\nfor whose sake I am in such continual sorrow.\" \\n\\nThen she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, \"Bring a seat with\\na fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his\\nstory, and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.\"\\n\\nEurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as\\nsoon as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, \"Stranger,\\nI shall first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town\\nand parents.\" \\n\\n\"Madam;\" answered Ulysses, \"who on the face of the whole earth can\\ndare to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven\\nitself; you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness,\\nas the monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its\\nwheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring\\nforth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues,\\nand his people do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here\\nin your house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know\\nmy race and family, or you will recall memories that will yet more\\nincrease my sorrow. I am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit\\nweeping and wailing in another person\\'s house, nor is it well to be\\nthus grieving continually. I shall have one of the servants or even\\nyourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tears\\nbecause I am heavy with wine.\" \\n\\nThen Penelope answered, \"Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,\\nwhether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and\\nmy dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my\\naffairs I should be both more respected and should show a better presence\\nto the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\\nwhich heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our\\nislands- Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself,\\nare wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore\\nshow no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who\\nsay that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time brokenhearted\\nabout Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to\\ninvent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven\\nput it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and\\nto begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I\\nsaid to them, \\'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not\\npress me to marry again immediately; wait- for I would not have my\\nskill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have finished making\\na pall for the hero Laertes, to be ready against the time when death\\nshall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk\\nif he is laid out without a pall.\\' This was what I said, and they\\nassented; whereon I used to keep working at my great web all day long,\\nbut at night I would unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled\\nthem in this way for three years without their finding it out, but\\nas time wore on and I was now in my fourth year, in the waning of\\nmoons, and many days had been accomplished, those good-for-nothing\\nhussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who broke in upon me\\nand caught me; they were very angry with me, so I was forced to finish\\nmy work whether I would or no. And now I do not see how I can find\\nany further shift for getting out of this marriage. My parents are\\nputting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at the ravages the\\nsuitors are making upon his estate, for he is now old enough to understand\\nall about it and is perfectly able to look after his own affairs,\\nfor heaven has blessed him with an excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding\\nall this, tell me who you are and where you come from- for you must\\nhave had father and mother of some sort; you cannot be the son of\\nan oak or of a rock.\" \\n\\nThen Ulysses answered, \"madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist\\nin asking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs\\nme: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as\\nlong as I have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless,\\nas regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair\\nand fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled\\nand there are nine cities in it: the people speak many different languages\\nwhich overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans,\\nDorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great town\\nthere, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had a conference\\nwith Jove himself. Minos was father to Deucalion, whose son I am,\\nfor Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus sailed\\nfor Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my brother,\\nhowever, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two; hence\\nit was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him hospitality, for\\nthe winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him\\nout of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in Amnisus off the\\ncave of Ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he\\ncould hardly find shelter from the winds that were then xaging. As\\nsoon as he got there he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus,\\nclaiming to be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already\\nset sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to\\nmy own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had abundance\\nof everything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with barley\\nmeal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and oxen\\nfor them to sacrifice to their heart\\'s content. They stayed with me\\ntwelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the North so strong\\nthat one could hardly keep one\\'s feet on land. I suppose some unfriendly\\ngod had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the wind dropped,\\nand they got away.\" \\n\\nMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept\\nas she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon\\nthe mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed\\nupon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even\\nso did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all\\nthe time sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was for her,\\nbut he kept his eyes as hard as or iron without letting them so much\\nas quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she\\nhad relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said:\\n\"Now, stranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no\\nyou really did entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did.\\nTell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look\\nat, and so also with his companions.\" \\n\\n\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"it is such a long time ago that I can\\nhardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home,\\nand went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect.\\nUlysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened\\nby a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this\\nthere was a device that showed a dog holding a spotted fawn between\\nhis fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground.\\nEvery one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done\\nin gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the\\nfawn was struggling convulsively to escape. As for the shirt that\\nhe wore next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the\\nskin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration\\nof all the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying\\nto your heart, that I do not know whether Ulysses wore these clothes\\nwhen he left home, or whether one of his companions had given them\\nto him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose house\\nhe was staying made him a present of them, for he was a man of many\\nfriends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a\\nsword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with\\na shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him on board his ship\\nwith every mark of honour. He had a servant with him, a little older\\nthan himself, and I can tell you what he was like; his shoulders were\\nhunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates,\\nand Ulysses treated him with greater familiarity than he did any of\\nthe others, as being the most like-minded with himself.\"\\n\\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable\\nproofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found\\nrelief in tears she said to him, \"Stranger, I was already disposed\\nto pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome\\nin my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I\\ntook them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I gave\\nhim also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never\\nwelcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out\\nfor that detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even\\nto mention.\" \\n\\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure yourself\\nfurther by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly\\nblame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne\\nhim children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even though\\nhe were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god. Still,\\ncease your tears and listen to what I can tell I will hide nothing\\nfrom you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately heard\\nof Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the Thesprotians,\\nand is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from\\none and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as\\nthey were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god\\nwere angry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god\\'s\\ncattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the\\nkeel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the Phaecians,\\nwho are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him as though\\nhe had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to escort\\nhim home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here long\\nago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth;\\nfor there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no one\\ncan compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all\\nthis, and he swore to me- making drink-offerings in his house as he\\ndid so- that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who\\nwould take Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there\\nhappened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island\\nof Dulichium, but he showed me all treasure Ulysses had got together,\\nand he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family\\nfor ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona\\nthat he might learn Jove\\'s mind from the high oak tree, and know whether\\nafter so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret.\\nSo you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at\\nhand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I\\nwill confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first\\nand mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses\\nto which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come\\nto pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end\\nof this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.\"\\n\\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true you\\nshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see\\nyou shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses\\nwill not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely\\nas that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such masters\\nin the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further\\nthem on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him,\\nand make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may\\nbe warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint\\nhim again, that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with\\nTelemachus. It shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people\\nwho is uncivil to him; like it or not, he shall have no more to do\\nin this house. For how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether or\\nno I am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heart and\\nunderstanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad?\\nMen live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal hardly,\\npeople wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously\\nof them when they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously,\\nthe people tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call\\nhim blessed.\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from\\nthe day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard.\\nI will lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night\\nafter night have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited\\nfor morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet washed; I shall\\nnot let any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet; but,\\nif you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as\\nmuch trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them.\" \\n\\nTo this Penelope said, \"My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet\\ncame to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with\\nsuch admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house\\na most respectable old woman- the same who received my poor dear husband\\nin her arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She\\nis very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.\" \"Come here,\" said\\nshe, \"Euryclea, and wash your master\\'s age-mate; I suppose Ulysses\\'\\nhands and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble\\nages all of us dreadfully fast.\" \\n\\nOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she\\nbegan to weep and made lamentation saying, \"My dear child, I cannot\\nthink whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more\\ngod-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole\\nworld ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs\\nwhen you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see\\nyour son grow up to take after you; yet see how he has prevented you\\nalone from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the\\nwomen in some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at\\nhim as all these sluts here have been gibing you. I do not wonder\\nat your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which\\nthey have insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough,\\nas Penelope has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for\\nPenelope\\'s sake and for your own, for you have raised the most lively\\nfeelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which\\npray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come\\nhere before now, but I make bold to say that no one ever yet came\\nwho was so like Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as you are.\"\\n\\n\"Those who have seen us both,\" answered Ulysses, \"have always said\\nwe were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.\\n\\nThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash\\nhis feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till\\nthe bath was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he\\nturned away from the light, for it occurred to him that when the old\\nwoman had hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar which\\nit bore, whereon the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon\\nas she began washing her master, she at once knew the scar as one\\nthat had been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on Mount\\nParnassus with his excellent grandfather Autolycus- who was the most\\naccomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world- and with the sons\\nof Autolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, for\\nhe used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he took\\npleasure in his companionship. It happened once that Autolycus had\\ngone to Ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born.\\nAs soon as he had done supper Euryclea set the infant upon his knees\\nand said, you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished\\nthat you might have one.\" \\n\\n\\'Son-in-law and daughter,\" replied Autolycus, \"call the child thus:\\nI am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place\\nand another, both men and women; so name the child \\'Ulysses,\\' or the\\nchild of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother\\'s family\\non Mount Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present\\nand will send him on his way rejoicing.\" \\n\\nUlysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from Autolycus,\\nwho with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome. His grandmother\\nAmphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head, and both\\nhis beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to get dinner\\nready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five year old\\nbull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these they\\nthen cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted\\nthem sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus through the\\nlivelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every\\nman had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun\\nset and it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of\\nsleep. \\n\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons\\nof Autolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went\\ntoo. They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached\\nits breezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon\\nthe fields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they\\ncame to a mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the\\ntracks of the beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons\\nof Autolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he\\nhad a long spear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among\\nsome thick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get\\nthrough it, nor could the sun\\'s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath\\nlay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men\\'s\\nfeet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up\\nto him, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck,\\nand stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the\\nfirst to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the\\nboar was too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him\\nabove the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach\\nthe bone. As for the boar, Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder,\\nand the point of the spear went right through him, so that he fell\\ngroaning in the dust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolycus\\nbusied themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses\\'\\nwound; then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went\\nhome as fast as they could. But when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly\\nhealed Ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent him\\nback to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, his father\\nand mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all about it, and\\nhow he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar\\nhad ripped him when he was out hunting with Autolycus and his sons\\non Mount Parnassus. \\n\\nAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had\\nwell hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. The\\nleg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that\\nall the water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea\\'s eyes between her\\njoy and her grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but\\nshe caught Ulysses by the beard and said, \"My dear child, I am sure\\nyou must be Ulysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually\\ntouched and handled you.\" \\n\\nAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell\\nher that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable\\nto look in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva\\nhad diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat\\nwith his right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said,\\n\"Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your\\nown breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last\\ncome to my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by\\nheaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about\\nit any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you- and it shall\\nsurely be- that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors,\\nI will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing\\nthe other women.\" \\n\\n\"My child,\" answered Euryclea, \"what are you talking about? You know\\nvery well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my\\ntongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and\\nlay my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors\\ninto your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who\\nhave been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.\" \\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way;\\nI am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold\\nyour tongue and leave everything to heaven.\" \\n\\nAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,\\nfor the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and\\nanointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to\\nwarm himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began\\ntalking to him and said: \\n\\n\"Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter.\\nIt is indeed nearly bed time- for those, at least, who can sleep in\\nspite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such\\nunmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties\\nand looking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during\\nthe whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed,\\nI lie awake thinking, and my heart comes a prey to the most incessant\\nand cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus,\\nsings in the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and\\nwith many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed\\nher own child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss\\nand turn in its uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here,\\nand safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house,\\nout of regard to public opinion and the memory of my late husband,\\nor whether it is not now time for me to go with the best of these\\nsuitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent presents.\\nAs long as my son was still young, and unable to understand, he would\\nnot hear of my leaving my husband\\'s house, but now that he is full\\ngrown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in\\nwhich the suitors are eating up his property. Listen, then, to a dream\\nthat I have had and interpret it for me if you can. I have twenty\\ngeese about the house that eat mash out of a trough, and of which\\nI am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great eagle came swooping\\ndown from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into the neck of each\\nof them till he had killed them all. Presently he soared off into\\nthe sky, and left them lying dead about the yard; whereon I wept in\\nmy room till all my maids gathered round me, so piteously was I grieving\\nbecause the eagle had killed my geese. Then he came back again, and\\nperching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice, and\\ntold me to leave off crying. \\'Be of good courage,\\' he said, \\'daughter\\nof Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen that shall\\nsurely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no longer\\nan eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who will\\nbring these suitors to a disgraceful end.\\' On this I woke, and when\\nI looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual.\"\\n\\n\"This dream, Madam,\" replied Ulysses, \"can admit but of one interpretation,\\nfor had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? The\\ndeath of the suitors is portended, and not one single one of them\\nwill escape.\" \\n\\nAnd Penelope answered, \"Stranger, dreams are very curious and unaccountable\\nthings, and they do not by any means invariably come true. There are\\ntwo gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one\\nis of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through the gate\\nof ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean something\\nto those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own dream\\ncame through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be most\\nthankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say- and lay\\nmy saying to your heart- the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened\\nday that is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about\\nto hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes\\nin the court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon which\\na ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow\\nthrough the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same\\nthing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily, and send\\nhis arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit\\nthis house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth.\\nBut even so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam wife of Ulysses, you need not defer\\nyour tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string\\nthe bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the\\niron.\" \\n\\nTo this Penelope said, \"As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk\\nto me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do\\npermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on\\nearth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline\\nupon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from\\nthe day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.\"\\n\\nShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by\\nher maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva\\nshed sweet sleep over her eyelids. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XX\\n\\nUlysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock\\'s hide, on\\nthe top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had\\neaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself\\ndown. There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in\\nwhich he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had\\nbeen in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the\\nhouse giggling and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very\\nangry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one\\nof them then and there, or to let them sleep one more and last time\\nwith the suitors. His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with\\npuppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did\\nhis heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done:\\nbut he beat his breast and said, \"Heart, be still, you had worse than\\nthis to bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions;\\nyet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe out of the\\ncave, though you made sure of being killed.\" \\n\\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but\\nhe tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in\\nfront of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other,\\nthat he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn\\nhimself about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single\\nhanded as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men\\nas the wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven\\nin the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, \"My\\npoor unhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house:\\nyour wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a\\nyoung man as any father may be proud of.\" \\n\\n\"Goddess,\" answered Ulysses, \"all that you have said is true, but\\nI am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked\\nsuitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are.\\nAnd there is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable.\\nSupposing that with Jove\\'s and your assistance I succeed in killing\\nthem, I must ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their\\navengers when it is all over.\" \\n\\n\"For shame,\" replied Minerva, \"why, any one else would trust a worse\\nally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less\\nwise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout\\nin all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though there were\\nfifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should\\ntake all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you. But\\ngo to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and you\\nshall be out of your troubles before long.\" \\n\\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to Olympus.\\n\\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that\\neased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting\\nup in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping\\nshe prayed to Diana saying, \"Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove,\\ndrive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch\\nme up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the\\nmouths of overflowing Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus.\\nThe daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods\\nkilled them, so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them,\\nand fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them to\\nexcel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them\\nan imposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of\\naccomplishment; but one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see\\nJove about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall\\nhappen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came and\\nspirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even\\nso I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal\\nsight, or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain go even\\nbeneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses\\nonly, and without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was.\\nBesides, no matter how much people may grieve by day, they can put\\nup with it so long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are\\nclosed in slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my misery\\nhaunts me even in my dreams. This very night methought there was one\\nlying by my side who was like Ulysses as he was when he went away\\nwith his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream,\\nbut the very truth itself.\" \\n\\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping,\\nand it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and\\nwas by his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on\\nwhich he had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he\\ntook the bullock\\'s hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands\\nto heaven, and prayed, saying \"Father Jove, since you have seen fit\\nto bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the afflictions\\nyou have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one\\nor other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me\\nhave another sign of some kind from outside.\" \\n\\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high\\nup among the from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad when\\nhe heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from\\nhard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another\\nsign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind\\nwheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground\\ntheir task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet\\nfinished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard\\nthe thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.\\n\"Father Jove,\" said she, \"you who rule over heaven and earth, you\\nhave thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it,\\nand this means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of\\nme your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very\\nlast day that the suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have\\nworn me out with the labour of grinding meal for them, and I hope\\nthey may never have another dinner anywhere at all.\" \\n\\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman\\'s\\nspeech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should\\navenge himself on the suitors. \\n\\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;\\nTelemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about\\nhis shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, and took a doughty\\nspear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold\\nof the cloister and said to Euryclea, \"Nurse, did you make the stranger\\ncomfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him shift\\nfor himself?- for my mother, good woman though she is, has a way of\\npaying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting others\\nwho are in reality much better men.\" \\n\\n\"Do not find fault child,\" said Euryclea, \"when there is no one to\\nfind fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he\\nliked: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and\\nhe said he would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants\\nto make one for him, but he said he was re such wretched outcast that\\nhe would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having\\nan undressed bullock\\'s hide and some sheepskins put for him in the\\ncloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.\" \\n\\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans\\nwere meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was\\nnot alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the\\nmaids and said, \"Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and\\nsprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the\\nseats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean\\nout the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for water from the fountain\\nat once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early,\\nfor it is a feast day.\" \\n\\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them\\nwent to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily\\nto work about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors\\nalso came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned\\nfrom the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three\\nbest pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises,\\nand then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses, \"Stranger, are the suitors\\ntreating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?\"\\n\\n\"May heaven,\" answered Ulysses, \"requite to them the wickedness with\\nwhich they deal high-handedly in another man\\'s house without any sense\\nof shame.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up,\\nfor he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors\\' dinner;\\nand he had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the\\ngatehouse, and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. \"Are you still\\nhere, stranger,\" said he, \"to pester people by begging about the house?\\nWhy can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding\\nbefore we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without\\nany sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans,\\nas well as here?\" \\n\\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third\\nman, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer\\nand some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there\\nto take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made\\nhis heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went\\nup to the swineherd. \"Who, Swineherd,\" said he, \"is this stranger\\nthat is lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family?\\nWhere does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some\\ngreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will- even to kings\\nif it so pleases them \\n\\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;\\n\"Good day to you, father stranger,\" said he, \"you seem to be very\\npoorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father\\nJove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children,\\nyet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat\\ncame over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for\\nhe reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about in just such rags\\nas this man\\'s are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is\\nalready dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,\\nwho made me his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians,\\nand now his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with\\nthem than I have, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless\\nI have to keep bringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed\\nof his son though he is in the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven,\\nbut are already eager to divide Ulysses\\' property among them because\\nhe has been away so long. I have often thought- only it would not\\nbe right while his son is living- of going off with the cattle to\\nsome foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still harder to\\nstay here and be ill-treated about other people\\'s herds. My position\\nis intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself\\nunder the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor\\nmaster will yet return, and send all these suitors flying out of the\\nhouse.\" \\n\\n\"Stockman,\" answered Ulysses, \"you seem to be a very well-disposed\\nperson, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will\\ntell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by Jove, the chief\\nof all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come,\\nUlysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so\\nminded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.\"\\n\\n\"If Jove were to bring this to pass,\" replied the stockman, \"you should\\nsee how I would do my very utmost to help him.\" \\n\\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\\n\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot\\nto murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand-\\nan eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, \"My friends,\\nthis plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go\\nto dinner instead.\" \\n\\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on\\nthe benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and\\nthe heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them\\nround. They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd\\ngave every man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in\\nthe breadbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then\\nthey laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\\n\\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister\\nthat was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a\\nlittle table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought\\nto him, with his wine in a gold cup. \"Sit there,\" said he, \"and drink\\nyour wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and\\nblows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to\\nUlysses, and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your\\nhands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief.\"\\n\\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\\nthen Antinous said, \"We do not like such language but we will put\\nup with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove\\nhad let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the\\nheralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the\\nAchaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo. \\n\\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every\\nman his portion, and feasted to their hearts\\' content; those who waited\\nat table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had,\\nfor Telemachus had told them to do so. \\n\\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence,\\nfor she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against them. Now\\nthere happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus,\\nand who came from Same. This man, confident in his great wealth, was\\npaying court to the wife of Ulysses, and said to the suitors, \"Hear\\nwhat I have to say. The stranger has already had as large a portion\\nas any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor reasonable\\nto ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I will, however,\\nmake him a present on my own account, that he may have something to\\ngive to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses\\' servants.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer\\'s foot from the meat-basket in which\\nit lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little\\naside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion as he did\\nso, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely\\nto Ctesippus, \"It is a good thing for you,\" said he, \"that the stranger\\nturned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should\\nhave run you through with my spear, and your father would have had\\nto see about getting you buried rather than married in this house.\\nSo let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am\\ngrown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what\\nis going on, instead of being the child that I have been heretofore.\\nI have long seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn\\nand wine: I have put up with this, for one man is no match for many,\\nbut do me no further violence. Still, if you wish to kill me, kill\\nme; I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after\\nday- guests insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the\\nhouse in an unseemly way.\" \\n\\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,\\n\"No one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay\\nit, for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating\\nthe stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house;\\nI would say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother,\\nwhich I trust may commend itself to both. \\'As long,\\' I would say,\\n\\'as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home,\\nno one could complain of your waiting and suffering the suitors to\\nbe in your house. It would have been better that he should have returned,\\nbut it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore\\ntalk all this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry\\nthe best man, and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer.\\nThus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and\\nto eat and drink in peace, while your mother will look after some\\nother man\\'s house, not yours.\"\\' \\n\\nTo this Telemachus answered, \"By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows\\nof my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or\\nis wandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way\\nof my mother\\'s marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever\\nshe will, and I will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but\\nI dare not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against\\nher own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do this.\" \\n\\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set\\ntheir wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.\\nTheir meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears,\\nand their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this\\nand said, \"Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud\\nof darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet\\nwith tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams\\ndrip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are\\nfull of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted\\nout of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus\\nthen said, \"This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses.\\nServants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark\\nhere.\" \\n\\nBut Theoclymenus said, \"Eurymachus, you need not send any one with\\nme. I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing\\nof an understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with\\nme, for I see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you\\nmen who are insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of\\nUlysses will be able to escape.\" \\n\\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him\\nwelcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking\\nTelemachus fly laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said\\nto him, \"Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have\\nthis importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no\\nskill for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and\\nnow here is another fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet.\\nLet me persuade you, for it will be much better, to put them on board\\nship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.\"\\n\\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father,\\nexpecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.\\n\\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had had a rich\\nseat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could\\nhear what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared\\namid merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed\\nmany victims; but the supper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived\\nmore gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man were soon\\nto lay before them- for they had brought their doom upon themselves.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XXI\\n\\nMinerva now put it in Penelope\\'s mind to make the suitors try their\\nskill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,\\nas a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs\\nand got the store room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle\\nof ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store room at the\\nend of the house, where her husband\\'s treasures of gold, bronze, and\\nwrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver\\nfull of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he\\nhad met in Lacedaemon- Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in\\nwith one another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses\\nwas staying in order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole\\npeople; for the Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from\\nIthaca, and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In\\nquest of these Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young,\\nfor his father and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover\\nthem. Iphitus had gone there also to try and get back twelve brood\\nmares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running with\\nthem. These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went\\nto the house of Jove\\'s son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies\\nof valour, Hercules to his shame killed him, though he was his guest,\\nfor he feared not heaven\\'s vengeance, nor yet respected his own table\\nwhich he had set before Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything,\\nand kept the mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus\\nmet Ulysses, and gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used\\nto carry, and which on his death had been left by him to his son.\\nUlysses gave him in return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning\\nof a fast friendship, although they never visited at one another\\'s\\nhouses, for Jove\\'s son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so.\\nThis bow, then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him\\nby Ulysses when he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had\\nbeen at home, but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from\\na valued friend. \\n\\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room; the\\ncarpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to\\nget it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and\\nhung the doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door,\\nput in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts\\nthat held the doors; these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing\\nin a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where\\nthe chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by\\nalong with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow\\nwith its bow case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with\\nit on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case,\\nand when her tears had relieved her, she went to the cloister where\\nthe suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly\\narrows that were inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing\\na chest that contained much iron and bronze which her husband had\\nwon as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the\\nbearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil\\nbefore her face, and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:\\n\\n\"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality\\nof this house because its owner has been long absent, and without\\nother pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the\\nprize that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow\\nof Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and\\nsend his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow\\nand quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding\\nin wealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my\\ndreams.\" \\n\\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron\\nbefore the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she\\nhad bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master\\'s\\nbow, but Antinous scolded them. \"You country louts,\" said he, \"silly\\nsimpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by\\ncrying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her\\nhusband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or\\ngo outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors\\nshall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find\\nit no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a\\nman of us all who is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him\\nand remember him, though I was then only a child.\" \\n\\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able\\nto string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was\\nto be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of\\nUlysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house- egging the others\\non to do so also. \\n\\nThen Telemachus spoke. \"Great heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"Jove must have\\nrobbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying\\nshe will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying\\nmyself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the\\ncontest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman\\nwhose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet\\nin Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what\\nneed have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no\\nexcuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or\\nno. I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot\\nthrough the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house\\nwith a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father won before\\nme.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from\\nhim, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in\\na row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had Wade straight\\nby line. Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone\\nwas surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had never\\nseen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement\\nto make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all\\nhis might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though\\nhe had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was\\ntrying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses\\nmade a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\\n\\n\"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am\\ntoo young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able\\nto hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are\\nstronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.\"\\n\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that\\nled into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the\\nbow. Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous\\nsaid: \\n\\n\"Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the\\nplace at which the. cupbearer begins when he is handing round the\\nwine.\" \\n\\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of OEnops was the first to rise.\\nHe was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near\\nthe mixing-bowl. He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and\\nwas indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow\\nand arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he\\ncould not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard\\nwork, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors,\\n\"My friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall\\ntake the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better\\nto die than to live after having missed the prize that we have so\\nlong striven for, and which has brought us so long together. Some\\none of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope,\\nbut when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal\\nofferings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever makes\\nher the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.\" \\n\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, with\\nthe arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat\\nagain on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him\\nsaying: \\n\\n\"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and\\nintolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this\\nbow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot\\nbend it yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there\\nare others who will soon string it.\" \\n\\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, \"Look sharp, light a fire\\nin the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring\\nus also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let\\nus warm the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again,\\nand bring the contest to an end.\" \\n\\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside\\nit. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the\\nhouse, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it,\\nbut they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless\\nthere still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders\\namong the suitors and much the foremost among them all. \\n\\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and\\nUlysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the\\nouter yard, Ulysses said to them quietly: \\n\\n\"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I\\nam in doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What\\nmanner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should\\nbring him back here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to\\ndo- to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?\" \\n\\n\"Father Jove,\" answered the stockman, \"would indeed that you might\\nso ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should\\nsee with what might and main I would fight for him.\" \\n\\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return;\\nwhen, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses\\nsaid, \"It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at\\nlast, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find\\nthat you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so,\\nfor I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you\\ntwo, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven\\nshall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both\\nof you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall\\nbe to me as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I\\nwill now give you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured.\\nSee, here is the scar from the boar\\'s tooth that ripped me when I\\nwas out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they\\nhad examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses,\\nthrew their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while\\nUlysses kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have\\ngone down upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and\\nsaid: \\n\\n\"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us,\\nand tell those who a are within. When you go in, do so separately,\\nnot both together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards;\\nLet this moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of\\nthem try to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do\\nyou, therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying\\nit about, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment.\\nIf they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house,\\nthey must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they\\nare at their work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the\\ndoors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat\\nthat he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\\n\\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming\\nit by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly\\ngrieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I grieve for myself and\\nfor us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but\\nI do not care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other\\nwomen in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our\\nbeing so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his\\nbow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.\"\\n\\n\"It shall not be so, Eurymachus,\" said Antinous, \"and you know it\\nyourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who\\ncan string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side- as for\\nthe axes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come\\nto the house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his\\ncups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of\\nthe bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow-\\nthe best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty\\narcher, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest\\nto an end.\" \\n\\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water\\nover the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls\\nwith wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his\\ndrink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk\\neach as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said: \\n\\n\"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as\\nI am minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous\\nwho has just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present\\nand leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give\\nvictory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow\\nthat I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether\\nI still have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel\\nand neglect have made an end of it.\" \\n\\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the\\nbow; Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, \"Wretched creature,\\nyou have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought\\nto think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your\\nbetters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others\\nhave had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other\\nbeggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves;\\nthe wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all\\nthose drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion\\nwhen he was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine\\nhad got into his head he went mad and did ill deeds about the house\\nof Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so\\nthey rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged\\nhim through the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed,\\nand bore the burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth,\\ntherefore, there was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he\\nbrought it upon himself through his own drunkenness. In like manner\\nI can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow:\\nyou will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship\\nyou off to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him:\\nyou will never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting\\ninto a quarrel with men younger than yourself.\" \\n\\nPenelope then spoke to him. \"Antinous,\" said she, \"it is not right\\nthat you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this\\nhouse. If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty\\nbow of Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him\\nand make me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in\\nhis mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would\\nbe out of all reason.\" \\n\\n\"Queen Penelope,\" answered Eurymachus, \"we do not suppose that this\\nman will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid\\nlest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should\\ngo gossiping about and say, \\'These suitors are a feeble folk; they\\nare paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them\\nwas able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house\\nstrung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.\\' This is what\\nwill be said, and it will be a scandal against us.\" \\n\\n\"Eurymachus,\" Penelope answered, \"people who persist in eating up\\nthe estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not\\nexpect others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men\\ntalk as you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built,\\nhe says moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and\\nlet us see whether he can string it or no. I say- and it shall surely\\nbe- that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will\\ngive him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off\\ndogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals,\\nand will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go.\" \\n\\nThen Telemachus said, \"Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca\\nor in the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to\\nlet any one have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one\\nway or the other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a\\npresent of the bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go,\\nthen, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your\\nloom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is\\na man\\'s matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master\\nhere.\" \\n\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\\'s saying\\nin her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,\\nshe mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her\\neyelids. \\n\\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses,\\nbut the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters,\\nand one of them said, \"You idiot, where are you taking the bow to?\\nAre you out of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant\\nour prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little\\nplace, and worry you to death.\" \\n\\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the\\nbow down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the\\nother side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, \"Father Eumaeus,\\nbring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you\\nwith stones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two.\\nI wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house\\nas I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry,\\nfor they mean mischief.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put\\nthem in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow\\non and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he\\ncalled Euryclea apart and said to her, \"Euryclea, Telemachus says\\nyou are to close the doors of the women\\'s apartments. If they hear\\nany groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are\\nnot to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at\\ntheir work.\" \\n\\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women\\'s apartments.\\n\\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of\\nthe outer court. There was a ship\\'s cable of byblus fibre lying in\\nthe gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in\\nagain, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses,\\nwho had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way\\nabout, and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating\\ninto its two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards\\nhis neighbour saying, \"This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either\\nhe has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\\nstyle does the old vagabond handle it.\" \\n\\nAnother said, \"I hope he may be no more successful in other things\\nthan he is likely to be in stringing this bow.\" \\n\\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung\\nit as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes\\nthe twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand\\nto prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the\\ntwittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour\\nas they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly\\nas a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen\\nthat the son of scheming Saturn had sent him. \\n\\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those which the\\nAchaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver-\\nhe laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the\\narrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he\\nhad taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes\\nof the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through\\nthem, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:\\n\\n\"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what\\nI aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,\\nand not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time\\nfor the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight,\\nand then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which\\nare the crowning ornaments of a banquet.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded\\non his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father\\'s\\nseat. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XXII\\n\\nThen Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement\\nwith his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on\\nto the ground at his feet and said, \"The mighty contest is at an end.\\nI will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another\\nmark which no man has yet hit.\" \\n\\nOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take\\nup a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in\\nhis hands. He had no thought of death- who amongst all the revellers\\nwould think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among so\\nmany and kill him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the\\npoint went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup\\ndropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his\\nnostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on it,\\nso that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over\\non to the ground. The suitors were in an uproar when they saw that\\na man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of them from\\ntheir seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but there was\\nneither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily. \"Stranger,\"\\nsaid they, \"you shall pay for shooting people in this way: om yi you\\nshall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you have\\nslain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour\\nyou for having killed him.\" \\n\\nThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by mistake,\\nand did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every\\none of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said: \\n\\n\"Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have\\nwasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you,\\nand have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared neither\\nCod nor man, and now you shall die.\" \\n\\nThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round\\nabout to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone\\nspoke. \\n\\n\"If you are Ulysses,\" said he, \"then what you have said is just. We\\nhave done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous\\nwho was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was\\nall his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did\\nnot so much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different,\\nand Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son\\nand to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met the\\ndeath which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make\\neverything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that\\nwe have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth\\ntwenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your\\nheart is softened. Until we have done this no one can complain of\\nyour being enraged against us.\" \\n\\nUlysses again glared at him and said, \"Though you should give me all\\nthat you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have,\\nI will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must\\nfight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall.\"\\n\\nTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:\\n\\n\"My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where\\nhe is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let\\nus then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield\\nyou from his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him\\nfrom the pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town,\\nand raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides,\\nand with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly\\nshot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed\\nitself in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over\\nhis table. The cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as\\nhe smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and\\nhe kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.\\n\\nThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try\\nand get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him,\\nand struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders\\nand went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground\\nand struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away\\nfrom him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that\\nif he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up\\nand hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at\\na run, and immediately was at his father\\'s side. Then he said:\\n\\n\"Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet\\nfor your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other\\narmour for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.\"\\n\\n\"Run and fetch them,\" answered Ulysses, \"while my arrows hold out,\\nor when I am alone they may get me away from the door.\" \\n\\nTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room\\nwhere the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and\\nfour brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all\\nspeed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and\\nthe swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places near\\nUlysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been\\nshooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another:\\nwhen his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end\\nwall of the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick\\nabout his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought\\nwith a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he\\ngrasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears. \\n\\nNow there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of the pavement\\nthere was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed\\nby a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door\\nand guard it, for only one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaus\\nshouted out, \"Cannot some one go up to the trap door and tell the\\npeople what is going on? Help would come at once, and we should soon\\nmake an end of this man and his shooting.\" \\n\\n\"This may not be, Agelaus,\" answered Melanthius, \"the mouth of the\\nnarrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court.\\nOne brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know\\nwhat I will do, I will bring you arms from the store room, for I am\\nsure it is there that Ulysses and his son have put them.\"\\n\\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store\\nroom of Ulysses, house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many\\nhelmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give\\nthem to the suitors. Ulysses\\' heart began to fail him when he saw\\nthe suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears.\\nHe saw the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, \"Some\\none of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may\\nbe Melanthius.\" \\n\\nTelemachus answered, \"The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I\\nleft the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out\\nthan I have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one\\nof the women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius\\nthe son of Dolius.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the\\nstore room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said\\nto Ulysses who was beside him, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it\\nis that scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to\\nthe store room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of\\nhim, or shall I bring him here that you may take your own revenge\\nfor all the many wrongs that he has done in your house?\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check,\\nno matter what they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius\\' hands\\nand feet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door\\nfast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him\\nclose up to the rafters from a high bearing-post, that he may linger\\non in an agony.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to\\nthe store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for\\nhe was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room,\\nso the two took their stand on either side of the door and waited.\\nBy and by Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old\\ndry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when\\nhe was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the\\nstraps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him\\nback by the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent\\nhis hands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with\\na painful bond as Ulysses had told them; then they fastened a noose\\nabout his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he was close\\nup to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus,\\nsaying, \"Melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as you\\ndeserve. You will know very well when morning comes from the streams\\nof Oceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for\\nthe suitors to feast on.\" \\n\\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on\\ntheir armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take\\ntheir places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in\\nthe cloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were\\nin the body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove\\'s\\ndaughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form\\nof Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, \"Mentor, lend\\nme your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns\\nhe has done you. Besides, you are my age-mate.\" \\n\\nBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from\\nthe other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the\\nfirst to reproach her. \"Mentor,\" he cried, \"do not let Ulysses beguile\\nyou into siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we\\nwill do: when we have killed these people, father and son, we will\\nkill you too. You shall pay for it with your head, and when we have\\nkilled you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and bring\\nit into hotch-pot with Ulysses\\' property; we will not let your sons\\nlive in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue\\nto live in the city of Ithaca.\" \\n\\nThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very\\nangrily. \"Ulysses,\" said she, \"your strength and prowess are no longer\\nwhat they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojans\\nabout the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those days, and\\nit was through your stratagem that Priam\\'s city was taken. How comes\\nit that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your\\nown ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? Come\\non, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alcinous\\nshall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him.\"\\n\\nBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still\\nfurther to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she\\nflew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat\\nupon it in the form of a swallow. \\n\\nMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,\\nPisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight\\nupon the suitors\\' side; of all those who were still fighting for their\\nlives they were by far the most valiant, for the others had already\\nfallen under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said,\\n\"My friends, he will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away\\nafter having done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the\\ndoors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw\\nyour spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory\\nby killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the\\nothers.\" \\n\\nThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all\\nof no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door;\\nthe pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they\\nhad avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own\\nmen, \"My friends, I should say we too had better let drive into the\\nmiddle of them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us\\nby us outright.\" \\n\\nThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.\\nUlysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus,\\nwhile the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as\\nthe others drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward\\nand regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.\\n\\nThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their\\nweapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of\\nthe cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft\\nof another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of\\nthe top skin from off Telemachus\\'s wrist, and Ctesippus managed to\\ngraze Eumaeus\\'s shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and\\nfell to the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd\\nof suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus\\nPolybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\\ntaunted him saying, \"Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so\\nfoolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your\\nspeech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present\\nof this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when\\nhe was begging about in his own house.\" \\n\\nThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with\\na spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor\\nin the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell\\nforward full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat\\non the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors\\nquailed. They fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle\\nmaddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their\\nlongest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains\\nswoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground,\\nand kill them, for they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on\\nenjoy the sport- even so did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors\\nand smite them on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their\\nbrains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood.\\n\\nLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, \"Ulysses I beseech\\nyou have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women\\nin your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others.\\nI saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for\\ntheir folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall\\ndie without having done anything to deserve it, and shall have got\\nno thanks for all the good that I did.\" \\n\\nUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, \"If you were their sacrificing\\npriest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before\\nI got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have children\\nby her. Therefore you shall die.\" \\n\\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when\\nhe was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he\\nstruck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling\\nin the dust while he was yet speaking. \\n\\nThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes- he who had been forced by the\\nsuitors to sing to them- now tried to save his life. He was standing\\nnear towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. He did\\nnot know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar\\nof Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and\\nUlysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to\\ngo straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he\\ndeemed it best to embrace Ulysses\\' knees. So he laid his lyre on the\\nground the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded seat;\\nthen going up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, \"Ulysses,\\nI beseech you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for\\nit afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both for gods and men\\nas I can. I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits me with every\\nkind of inspiration. I would sing to you as though you were a god,\\ndo not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your own son\\nTelemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent your house\\nand sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many\\nand too strong for me, so they made me.\" \\n\\nTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. \"Hold!\" he\\ncried, \"the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will Medon too,\\nwho was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus\\nhas already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you were\\nraging about the court.\" \\n\\nMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under\\na seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly\\nflayed heifer\\'s hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus,\\nand laid hold of his knees. \\n\\n\"Here I am, my dear sir,\" said he, \"stay your hand therefore, and\\ntell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors\\nfor having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful\\nto yourself.\" \\n\\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \"Fear not; Telemachus has saved\\nyour life, that you may know in future, and tell other people, how\\ngreatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside\\nthe cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way of the slaughter-\\nyou and the bard- while I finish my work here inside.\" \\n\\nThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat\\ndown by Jove\\'s great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting\\nthat they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully\\nover, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living,\\nbut he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood.\\nThey were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea,\\nand thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of\\nthe sun makes an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying all huddled\\nup one against the other. \\n\\nThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, \"Call nurse Euryclea; I have something\\nto say to her.\" \\n\\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women\\'s room. \"Make\\nhaste,\" said he, \"you old woman who have been set over all the other\\nwomen in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you.\"\\n\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women\\'s room\\nand came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses\\nbespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring\\nan ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so that\\nhe is a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses besmirched from head to\\nfoot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of\\nblood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great\\ndeed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, \"Old woman,\" said he,\\n\"rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise\\nabout it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven\\'s doom\\nand their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction, for\\nthey respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who\\ncame near them, and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for\\ntheir wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women\\nin the house have misconducted themselves, and who are innocent.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" answered Euryclea. \"There are\\nfifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding\\nwool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all have\\nmisbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope.\\nThey showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only lately grown\\nand his mother never permitted him to give orders to the female servants;\\nbut let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that has happened, for\\nsome god has been sending her to sleep.\" \\n\\n\"Do not wake her yet,\" answered Ulysses, \"but tell the women who have\\nmisconducted themselves to come to me.\" \\n\\nEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to\\nUlysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the\\nswineherd. \"Begin,\" said he, \"to remove the dead, and make the women\\nhelp you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables\\nand seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters,\\ntake the women into the space between the domed room and the wall\\nof the outer court, and run them through with your swords till they\\nare quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in which\\nthey used to lie in secret with the suitors.\" \\n\\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.\\nFirst they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against\\none another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made\\nthem do their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When\\nthey had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges\\nand water, while Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood\\nand dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away and put\\nit out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean\\nand orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow\\nspace between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so\\nthat they could not get away: and Telemachus said to the other two,\\n\"I shall not let these women die a clean death, for they were insolent\\nto me and my mother, and used to sleep with the suitors.\"\\n\\nSo saying he made a ship\\'s cable fast to one of the bearing-posts\\nthat supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around\\nthe building, at a good height, lest any of the women\\'s feet should\\ntouch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that\\nhas been set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their\\nnest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have\\nto put their heads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably.\\nTheir feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.\\n\\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner\\ncourt. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his\\nvitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they\\ncut off his hands and his feet. \\n\\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went\\nback into the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the\\ndear old nurse Euryclea, \"Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution,\\nand fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters.\\nGo, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants,\\nand also all the maid servants that are in the house.\" \\n\\n\"All that you have said is true,\" answered Euryclea, \"but let me bring\\nyou some clean clothes- a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags\\non your back any longer. It is not right.\" \\n\\n\"First light me a fire,\" replied Ulysses. \\nShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses\\nthoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts.\\nThen she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened;\\nwhereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands,\\nand pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders\\nand taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like\\nto weep, for he remembered every one of them. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XXIII\\n\\nEuryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her\\ndear husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and\\nher feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent\\nover her head to speak to her. \"Wake up Penelope, my dear child,\"\\nshe exclaimed, \"and see with your own eyes something that you have\\nbeen wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come\\nhome again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble\\nin his house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son.\"\\n\\n\"My good nurse,\" answered Penelope, \"you must be mad. The gods sometimes\\nsend some very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish\\npeople become sensible. This is what they must have been doing to\\nyou; for you always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you\\nthus mock me when I have trouble enough already- talking such nonsense,\\nand waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of\\nmy eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from the day\\nmy poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back\\nagain into the women\\'s room; if it had been any one else, who had\\nwoke me up to bring me such absurd news I should have sent her away\\nwith a severe scolding. As it is, your age shall protect you.\"\\n\\n\"My dear child,\" answered Euryclea, \"I am not mocking you. It is quite\\ntrue as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger\\nwhom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus\\nknew all the time that he was come back, but kept his father\\'s secret\\nthat he might have his revenge on all these wicked people.\\n\\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea,\\nand wept for joy. \"But my dear nurse,\" said she, \"explain this to\\nme; if he has really come home as you say, how did he manage to overcome\\nthe wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there\\nalways were?\" \\n\\n\"I was not there,\" answered Euryclea, \"and do not know; I only heard\\nthem groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled\\nup in a corner of the women\\'s room with the doors closed, till your\\nson came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses\\nstanding over the corpses that were lying on the ground all round\\nhim, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you could\\nhave seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and filth,\\nand looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled up\\nin the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a\\ngreat fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call\\nyou, so come with me that you may both be happy together after all;\\nfor now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your\\nhusband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, and\\nto take his revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so\\nbadly to him.\" \\n\\n\"\\'My dear nurse,\" said Penelope, \"do not exult too confidently over\\nall this. You know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses\\ncome home- more particularly myself, and the son who has been born\\nto both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some\\ngod who is angry with the suitors for their great wickedness, and\\nhas made an end of them; for they respected no man in the whole world,\\nneither rich nor poor, who came near them, who came near them, and\\nthey have come to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity. Ulysses\\nis dead far away from the Achaean land; he will never return home\\nagain.\" \\n\\nThen nurse Euryclea said, \"My child, what are you talking about? but\\nyou were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband\\nis never coming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side\\nat this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I\\nwas washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave him,\\nand I wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not\\nlet me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I\\nwill make this bargain with you- if I am deceiving you, you may have\\nme killed by the most cruel death you can think of.\" \\n\\n\"My dear nurse,\" said Penelope, \"however wise you may be you can hardly\\nfathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search\\nof my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man\\nwho has killed them.\" \\n\\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she\\nconsidered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband\\nand question him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace\\nhim. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister,\\nshe sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the wall at right\\nangles [to that by which she had entered], while Ulysses sat near\\none of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting to\\nsee what his wife would say to him when she saw him. For a long time\\nshe sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked\\nhim full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his\\nshabby clothes and failed to recognize him, till Telemachus began\\nto reproach her and said: \\n\\n\"Mother- but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name-\\nwhy do you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit\\nby his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions? No\\nother woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come\\nback to her after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through\\nso much; but your heart always was as hard as a stone.\" \\n\\nPenelope answered, \"My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can\\nfind no words in which either to ask questions or to answer them.\\nI cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is\\nUlysses come back to his own home again, we shall get to understand\\none another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we two\\nare alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others.\"\\n\\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, \"Let your mother put\\nme to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently.\\nShe rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else,\\nbecause I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us,\\nhowever, consider what we had better do next. When one man has killed\\nanother, even though he was not one who would leave many friends to\\ntake up his quarrel, the man who has killed him must still say good\\nbye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing\\nthe stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would\\nhave you consider this matter.\" \\n\\n\"Look to it yourself, father,\" answered Telemachus, \"for they say\\nyou are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other\\nmortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right\\ngood will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength\\nholds out.\" \\n\\n\"I will say what I think will be best,\" answered Ulysses. \"First wash\\nand put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room\\nand dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre,\\nso that if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some\\none going along the street happens to notice it, they may think there\\nis a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the death of the suitors\\nwill get about in the town, before we can escape to the woods upon\\nmy own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven\\nvouchsafes us shall seem wisest.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed\\nand put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took\\nhis lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance.\\nThe house re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the\\npeople outside said, \"I suppose the queen has been getting married\\nat last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to\\nprotect her husband\\'s property until he comes home.\" \\n\\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had\\nbeen happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses\\nin his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made\\nhim look taller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow\\nthick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth\\nblossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a\\nskilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva-\\nand his work is full of beauty- enriches a piece of silver plate by\\ngilding it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals,\\nand sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. \"My dear,\"\\nsaid he, \"heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than\\nwoman ever yet had. No other woman could bear to keep away from her\\nhusband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence,\\nand after having gone through so much. But come, nurse, get a bed\\nready for me; I will sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard\\nas iron.\" \\n\\n\"My dear,\" answered Penelope, \"I have no wish to set myself up, nor\\nto depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very\\nwell remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.\\nNevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that\\nhe himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding\\nupon it with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.\" \\n\\nShe said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, \"Wife,\\nI am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has been\\ntaking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found\\nit a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some\\ngod came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living, however\\nstrong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for it\\nis a marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands. There\\nwas a young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full\\nvigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round\\nthis with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them, and I made\\nthe doors strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of\\nthe olive tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly\\nfrom the root upwards and then worked with carpenter\\'s tools well\\nand skilfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood,\\nand making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle,\\nand made it the centre-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had\\nfinished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched\\na hide of crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you\\nsee I know all about it, and I desire to learn whether it is still\\nthere, or whether any one has been removing it by cutting down the\\nolive tree at its roots.\" \\n\\nWhen she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke\\ndown. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck,\\nand kissed him. \"Do not be angry with me Ulysses,\" she cried, \"you,\\nwho are the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven\\nhas denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing\\nold, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did\\nnot embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering\\nall the time through fear that someone might come here and deceive\\nme with a lying story; for there are many very wicked people going\\nabout. Jove\\'s daughter Helen would never have yielded herself to a\\nman from a foreign country, if she had known that the sons of Achaeans\\nwould come after her and bring her back. Heaven put it in her heart\\nto do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin, which has been the\\nsource of all our sorrows. Now, however, that you have convinced me\\nby showing that you know all about our bed (which no human being has\\never seen but you and I and a single maid servant, the daughter of\\nActor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who keeps\\nthe doors of our room) hard of belief though I have been I can mistrust\\nno longer.\" \\n\\nThen Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and\\nfaithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men\\nwho are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their\\nship with the fury of his winds and waves- a few alone reach the land,\\nand these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves\\non firm ground and out of danger- even so was her husband welcome\\nto her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear her two fair\\narms from about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging\\ntheir sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined\\notherwise, and held night back in the far west, while she would not\\nsuffer Dawn to leave Oceanus, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampus and\\nPhaethon that bear her onward to break the day upon mankind.\\n\\nAt last, however, Ulysses said, \"Wife, we have not yet reached the\\nend of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo.\\nIt is long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus\\nthe shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I\\nwent down into Hades to ask about my return and that of my companions.\\nBut now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed\\nboon of sleep.\" \\n\\n\"You shall go to bed as soon as you please,\" replied Penelope, \"now\\nthat the gods have sent you home to your own good house and to your\\ncountry. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell\\nme about the task that lies before you. I shall have to hear about\\nit later, so it is better that I should be told at once.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" answered Ulysses, \"why should you press me to tell you?\\nStill, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it.\\nI do not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide,\\ncarrying an oar, till I came to a country where the people have never\\nheard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. They know\\nnothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He\\ngave me this certain token which I will not hide from you. He said\\nthat a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing\\nshovel that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my oar in\\nthe ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune; after\\nwhich I was to go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven,\\none after the other. As for myself, he said that death should come\\nto me from the sea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when\\nI was full of years and peace of mind, and my people should bless\\nme. All this, he said, should surely come to pass.\" \\n\\nAnd Penelope said, \"If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier\\ntime in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from\\nmisfortune.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches\\nand made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid\\nthem, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving\\nthe bed chamber woman Eurynome to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed\\nby torch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went\\nback, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.\\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and\\nmade the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep\\nin the cloisters. \\n\\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking\\nwith one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing\\nthe house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so\\nmany sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of\\nwine. Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much\\ntrouble he had himself given to other people. He told her everything,\\nand she was so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till\\nhe had ended his whole story. \\n\\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached\\nthe fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops\\nand how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave\\ncomrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably\\nand furthered him on his way, but even so he was not to reach home,\\nfor to his great grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how\\nhe went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed\\nall his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only.\\nThen he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to\\nthe chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet\\nTeiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother\\nwho bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard\\nthe wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks\\nand terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed\\nin safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how\\nJove therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, so that all\\nhis men perished together, himself alone being left alive; how at\\nlast he reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso, who kept\\nhim there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in\\nwhich case she intended making him immortal so that he should never\\ngrow old, but she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how\\nafter much suffering he had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had\\ntreated him as though he had been a god, and sent him back in a ship\\nto his own country after having given him gold, bronze, and raiment\\nin great abundance. This was the last thing about which he told her,\\nfor here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his\\nsorrows. \\n\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that\\nUlysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned\\nDawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On\\nthis, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope,\\n\"Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here,\\nin lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home\\nthough I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however, that we\\nhave at last come together, take care of the property that is in the\\nhouse. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten,\\nI will take many myself by force from other people, and will compel\\nthe Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall have filled all\\nmy yards. I am now going to the wooded lands out in the country to\\nsee my father who has so long been grieved on my account, and to yourself\\nI will give these instructions, though you have little need of them.\\nAt sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have been killing the\\nsuitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there with your women. See\\nnobody and ask no questions.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus, Philoetius,\\nand Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also. This they\\ndid, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they opened the\\ngates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now daylight,\\nbut Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led them quickly\\nout of the town. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XXIV\\n\\nThen Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in\\nhis hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men\\'s eyes\\nin sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the\\nghosts and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind\\nhim. As bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when\\none of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even\\nso did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow\\nled them down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the\\nwaters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the gates of the\\nsun and the land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel\\nwhere dwell the souls and shadows of them that can labour no more.\\n\\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of\\nPatroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest\\nman of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself. \\n\\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost\\nof Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered\\nalso the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of\\nAeisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first. \\n\\n\"Son of Atreus,\" it said, \"we used to say that Jove had loved you\\nbetter from first to last than any other hero, for you were captain\\nover many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before\\nTroy; yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid\\nupon you all too early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the\\nhey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound\\nover your ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good name,\\nwhereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.\"\\n\\n\"Happy son of Peleus,\" answered the ghost of Agamemnon, \"for having\\ndied at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and\\nthe Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay\\nin the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now\\nof your chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should\\nwe ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us.\\nThen, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid\\nyou on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with\\nointments. The Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about\\nyou. Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from\\nout of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing went forth over the\\nwaters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled\\npanic-stricken to their ships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel\\nwas ever truest checked them saying, \\'Hold, Argives, fly not sons\\nof the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea with her immortal\\nnymphs to view the body of her son.\\' \\n\\n\"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of\\nthe old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed\\nyou in immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their\\nsweet voices in lament- calling and answering one another; there was\\nnot an Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and\\nnights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on\\nthe eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep\\nwith many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt\\nin raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,\\nhorse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning,\\nwith the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven\\nhad done their work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and\\nlaid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a\\ngolden vase to hold them- gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself;\\nin this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus who\\nhad gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those of Antilochus,\\nwho had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that\\nPatroclus was no more. \\n\\n\"Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point\\njutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far\\nout upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born\\nhereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them\\nto be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have\\nbeen present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird\\nthemselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some\\ngreat chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in\\ndeath your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives\\nevermore among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when\\nthe days of my fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction\\non my return, by the hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with\\nthe ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts\\nof Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went\\nup to them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son\\nof Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began\\nto talk to him. \\n\\n\"Amphimedon,\" it said, \"what has happened to all you fine young men-\\nall of an age too- that you are come down here under the ground? One\\ncould pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his\\nwinds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies\\nmake an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or\\nsheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of their wives and city?\\nAnswer my question, for I have been your guest. Do you not remember\\nhow I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to join\\nus with his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could\\nresume our voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come\\nwith us.\" \\n\\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king\\nof men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you\\nfully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.\\nUlysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did\\nnot say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters\\nto an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this, then, was\\nthe trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room\\nand began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. \\'Sweethearts,\\'\\nsaid she, \\'Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry\\nagain immediately; wait- for I would not have my skill in needlework\\nperish unrecorded- till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,\\nagainst the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the\\nwomen of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.\\' This\\nis what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working\\nupon her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the\\nstitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three\\nyears without our finding it out, but as time wore on and she was\\nnow in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many days had been\\naccomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us,\\nand we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish\\nit whether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had\\nmade, after she had had it washed, its splendour was as that of the\\nsun or moon. \\n\\n\"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where\\nhis swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning\\nfrom a voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had\\nhatched their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and\\nthen after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in\\nrags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar.\\nHe came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older\\nones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured\\nboth being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his\\nown house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he\\nand Telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting\\nthe doors behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow\\nand a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors;\\nand this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string\\nthe bow- nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the hands of\\nUlysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him,\\nno matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having\\nit. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent\\nhis arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister\\nand poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First\\nhe killed Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly\\nhis deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain\\nthat some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us\\nwith might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous\\nsound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the ground\\nseethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end,\\nand our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the house of Ulysses,\\nfor our friends at home do not yet know what has happened, so that\\nthey cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our wounds, making\\nmoan over us according to the offices due to the departed.\"\\n\\n\"Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,\" replied the ghost of Agamemnon, \"you\\nare indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare\\nexcellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as\\nPenelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue\\nshall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall\\nbe welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope.\\nHow far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus\\nwho killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men,\\nfor she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the\\nbowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of\\nthe town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes,\\nwhich he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with\\na lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked for him\\nslept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel\\nwoman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses\\ngot there, he said to his son and to the other two: \\n\\n\"Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.\\nMeanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to\\nrecognize me after so long an absence.\" \\n\\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius,\\nwho went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard\\nto make trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard,\\nhe did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen,\\nfor they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard,\\nat the place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his\\nfather alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched\\nand very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to\\nsave him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he\\nhad a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone.\\nWhen Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood\\nstill under a tall pear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether\\nto embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having come home,\\nor whether he should first question him and see what he would say.\\nIn the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in this mind\\nhe went up to his father, who was bending down and digging about a\\nplant. \\n\\n\"I see, sir,\" said Ulysses, \"that you are an excellent gardener- what\\npains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not\\na fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace\\nof your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended\\nif I say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself.\\nYou are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because\\nyou are idle that your master takes such poor care of you, indeed\\nyour face and figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim\\nyou of noble birth. I should have said that you were one of those\\nwho should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have\\na right to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you,\\nand in whose garden are you working? Tell me also about another matter.\\nIs this place that I have come to really Ithaca? I met a man just\\nnow who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience\\nto hear my story out when I was asking him about an old friend of\\nmine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the\\nhouse of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my\\nhouse once when I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger\\ncome to me whom I liked better. He said that his family came from\\nIthaca and that his father was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received\\nhim hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house,\\nand when he went away I gave him all customary presents. I gave him\\nseven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with flowers\\nchased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces\\nof tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve\\nrugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this\\nI added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts, and I\\nlet him take his choice.\" \\n\\nHis father shed tears and answered, \"Sir, you have indeed come to\\nthe country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of\\nwicked people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose.\\nIf you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would\\nhave entertained you hospitably and would have required your presents\\namply when you left him- as would have been only right considering\\nwhat you have already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how\\nmany years is it since you entertained this guest- my unhappy son,\\nas ever was? Alas! He has perished far from his own country; the fishes\\nof the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and\\nwild beasts of some continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father,\\nwho were his parents, could throw our arms about him and wrap him\\nin his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope\\nbewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed, and close his\\neyes according to the offices due to the departed. But now, tell me\\ntruly for I want to know. Who and whence are you- tell me of your\\ntown and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you and\\nyour men to Ithaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man\\'s ship,\\nand those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you?\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you everything,\" answered Ulysses, \"quite truly. I come\\nfrom Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas,\\nwho is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove\\nme off my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried\\nhere against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off\\nthe open country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since\\nUlysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for\\nhim when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both\\nhe and I rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope\\nthat we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents.\"\\n\\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled\\nboth hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his\\ngrey head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was\\ntouched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then\\nhe sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying,\\n\"I am he, father, about whom you are asking- I have returned after\\nhaving been away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation-\\nwe have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing\\nthe suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes.\"\\n\\n\"If you really are my son Ulysses,\" replied Laertes, \"and have come\\nback again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity\\nas shall convince me.\" \\n\\n\"First observe this scar,\" answered Ulysses, \"which I got from a boar\\'s\\ntusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus. You and my mother had\\nsent me to Autolycus, my mother\\'s father, to receive the presents\\nwhich when he was over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore\\nI will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me,\\nand I asked you all about them as I followed you round the garden.\\nWe went over them all, and you told me their names and what they all\\nwere. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty\\nfig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there\\nwas corn planted between each row, and they yield grapes of every\\nkind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavy upon them.\"\\n\\nLaertes\\' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which\\nhis son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had\\nto support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon\\nas he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, \"O\\nfather Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the\\nsuitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless,\\nI am much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up\\nhere directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout\\nthe cities of the Cephallenians.\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that,\\nbut let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told\\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner\\nready as soon as possible.\" \\n\\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they\\ngot there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd\\ncutting up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman\\ntook Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She\\nput him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a\\nmore imposing presence, making him taller and stouter than before.\\nWhen he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like\\nan immortal, and said to him, \"My dear father, some one of the gods\\nhas been making you much taller and better-looking.\" \\n\\nLaertes answered, \"Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that\\nI were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took\\nNericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what\\nI then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,\\nI should have been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors.\\nI should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced\\nto see it.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their\\nwork and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his\\nproper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by\\nand by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their\\nmother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was growing\\nold, had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were certain\\nit was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses scolded\\nthem good-naturedly and said, \"Sit down to your dinner, old man, and\\nnever mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for\\nsome time and have been waiting for you.\" \\n\\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. \"Sir,\"\\nsaid he, seizing his master\\'s hand and kissing it at the wrist, \"we\\nhave long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to\\nus after we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the\\ngods prosper you. But tell me, does Penelope already know of your\\nreturn, or shall we send some one to tell her?\" \\n\\n\"Old man,\" answered Ulysses, \"she knows already, so you need not trouble\\nabout that.\" On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered\\nround Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other;\\nthen they took their seats in due order near Dolius their father.\\n\\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went\\nround the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen\\nthe suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered\\nfrom every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.\\nThey took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies\\nof those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for\\nthe fishermen to take each of them to his own place. They then met\\nangrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got together\\nEupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death\\nof his son Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses,\\nso he said, weeping bitterly, \"My friend, this man has done the Achaeans\\ngreat wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet,\\nand he has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he\\nhas been killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let\\nus be up and doing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where\\nthe Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards.\\nIt will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder\\nof our sons and brothers. For my own part I should have no mote pleasure\\nin life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after\\nthem, before they can cross over to the mainland.\" \\n\\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard\\nPhemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses.\\nEvery one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle\\nof the assembly, and Medon said, \"Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses\\ndid not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an\\nimmortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god\\nappeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously\\nabout the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick\\non one another.\" \\n\\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor,\\nrose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past\\nand future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\\n\\n\"Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out\\nas they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when\\nwe bade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong\\nin the wantonness of their hearts- wasting the substance and dishonouring\\nthe wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however,\\nlet it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against Ulysses,\\nor you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your own heads.\"\\n\\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and\\nat once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for\\nthe speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;\\nthey therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed\\nthemselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes\\nled them on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the\\nmurder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to return, but was\\nhimself to perish in his attempt. \\n\\nThen Minerva said to Jove, \"Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,\\nanswer me this question- What do you propose to do? Will you set them\\nfighting still further, or will you make peace between them?\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by\\nyour own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon\\nthe suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think\\nwill be most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged,\\nlet them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue\\nto rule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre\\nof their sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as heretofore,\\nand let peace and plenty reign.\" \\n\\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she\\ndarted from off the topmost summits of Olympus. \\n\\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by\\nsaying, \"Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close\\nup to us.\" So one of Dolius\\'s sons went as he was bid. Standing on\\nthe threshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses,\\n\"Here they are, let us put on our armour at once.\" \\n\\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could- that is to say Ulysses,\\nhis three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius\\ndid the same- warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When\\nthey had all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied\\nforth, Ulysses leading the way. \\n\\nThen Jove\\'s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form\\nand voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to\\nhis son Telemachus, \"Telemachus, now that are about to fight in an\\nengagement, which will show every man\\'s mettle, be sure not to disgrace\\nyour ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and courage all\\nthe world over.\" \\n\\n\"You say truly, my dear father,\" answered Telemachus, \"and you shall\\nsee, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.\"\\n\\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. \"Good heavens, he exclaimed,\\n\"what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson\\nare vying with one another in the matter of valour.\" \\n\\nOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, \"Son of Arceisius-\\nbest friend I have in the world- pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and\\nto Jove her father; then poise your spear and hurl it.\" \\n\\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed\\nto her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes\\' helmet,\\nand the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not,\\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\\nMeantime Ulysses and his son fell the front line of the foe and smote\\nthem with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed\\nevery one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,\\nonly Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. \"Men\\nof Ithaca,\" she cried, cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter\\nat once without further bloodshed.\" \\n\\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their\\narms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound\\nof the goddess\\'s voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives.\\nBut Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped\\ndown like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt\\nof fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses,\\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will\\nbe angry with you.\" \\n\\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed\\nthe form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace\\nbetween the two contending parties. \\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCopyright statement:\\nThe Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C.
