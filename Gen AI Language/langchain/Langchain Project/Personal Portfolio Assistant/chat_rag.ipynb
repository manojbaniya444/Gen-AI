Beside web development I also like to train Deep Neural Network for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to make intelligent AI application.\\n\\n## my journey of coding\\nI started my coding journey after I joined my Bachelor in Computer Engineering but I had interest in Technology since I was 10. I became familiar with coding couple of years ago and since then I have been hooked into it.\\n\\n## My Education\\nI completed my Secondary Level from Nambin English Boarding School in Jhapa Nepal.\\n\\nI completed my High School from Devi Secondary School Jhapa Nepal where I studied Physics Mathematics and Chemistry.\\n\\nThen I joined Bachelor in Computer Engineering at TU IOE in 2021.\\n\\nDuring my Computer Engineering I explored many domains in tech.\\n\\n## what interests me\\nI love building web application which is interactive, engaging to user and scalable to handle anything.\\nI also like to train machine learning models especially Deep Neural Networks for common Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing task as hobby.\\nBesides coding I like to listen music and play musical instrument.\\n\\n## my tech stach\\nI am comfortable coding in javascript, typescipt and python programming language.\\nFor the frontend I use React library with tailwind css for building.\\n\\nFor the backend I use epxress js framework for building web server and sometimes I use plain node js without anything.\\n\\nI am familiar with both relational and non relational database system and I use mongo db and postgreSQL for that.\\n\\nI also know basic devops and have basic experience with tools like Docker,git, Kubernetes and some CI CD tools.\\n\\nI also use Microsoft Azure for Cloud Services and has experience in deploying web app in cloud.\\n\\n## my projects\\nI have done several personal projects and you can view at my github <link>https://github.com/manojbaniya444</link>\\n\\nProject 1. Ecommerce application\\nStack: React, Express, MongoDB, Tailwind css style\\n- fullstack MERN Ecommerce website where user can register login view products and order and admin manages the products and orders.\\n\\nProject 2. Real Time Messaging\\nStack: React, Express, socket.io, mongodb database\\n- Real time chat application where user can chat with other logged in user.\\n\\nProject 3. facebook clone\\nStack: React, Firebase for backend\\n- facebook clone where user can post comment share stories and chat in real time with other logged in users.\\n\\nProject 4. Movie website\\nStack: React, Firebase, TMDB API for movie\\n- use can search movies and get details about the movie and also watch trailer.\\n\\n## my working experience\\nI am still a fresher and have not joined any companies yet and yet to experience industry but have done some projects with friends in my college.\\n\\nCollege Project 1. Nepali License Plate Detection and Recognition\\nDomain: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, python\\n\\nTrained a machine learning model to classify nepali characters and fine Tuned a YOLO model for license plate detection. Then built a tikinter app to allow user to send image or video then get the license plate characters predicted.\\n\\nThis was a great experience because from data collection, labeling to training models and then integrating in graphical user interface was a challenging task and was not possible without our supervisor and friends support.\\n\\nCollege Project 2. Roman Nepali Language Ecommerce Chatbot\\nDomain: Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Large Language Model, Generative AI\\n\\nThis is our final year project at TU IOE and we explored different techniques to develop a chatbot including rule based, retrieval and generation based chatbot. In terms of developing we faced many problems like dataset for roman nepali, hardware resources to train, constraint time to complete project and also due to lack of pretrained Large Language Models in Roman Nepali Language.\\n\\n## my contact information\\nMy Phone Number: +977 9824095815\\nMy Email Address: manojbaniya474@gmail.com\\nMy Address: Nepal\\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/manoj-baniya-747683265/\\nMy Github Account: https://github.com/manojbaniya444')]"
