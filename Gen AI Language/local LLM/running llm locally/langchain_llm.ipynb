Narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a single task, such as facial recognition, voice recognition or language translation.\\n2. General or strong AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human can, such as reasoning, problem-solving and decision-making.\\n3. Superintelligence, which is beyond the capabilities of any humans in their prime ability. It involves machines learning and understanding things at a pace and level that far exceeds human capability.\\n\\nExamples of AI include:\\n1. Siri or Alexa, virtual assistants that can perform tasks such as scheduling appointments, sending messages, playing music or turning on lights in a smart home environment.\\n2.
