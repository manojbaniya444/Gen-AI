Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals. For example, consider a contact center AI agent that wants to resolves customer queries. The agent will automatically ask the customer different questions, look up information in internal documents, and respond with a solution. Based on the customer responses, it determines if it can resolve the query itself or pass it on to a human.\\n\\nWhat are the key principles that define AI agents?\\nAll software autonomously completes different tasks as determined by the software developer.

An AI agent senses its environment with physical or software interfaces.\\n\\nFor example, a robotic agent collects sensor data, and a chatbot uses customer queries as input. Then, the AI agent applies the data to make an informed decision. It analyzes the collected data to predict the best outcomes that support predetermined goals. The agent also uses the results to formulate the next action that it should take.

       "'Question 1: Here are three sub-questions related to \"What is an AI Agent?\":\\n\\n Answer: What makes AI or intelligent agents special is that they are rational agents that make rational decisions based on their perceptions and data to produce optimal performance and results.\\n\\nQuestion 2: \\n\\n Answer: The key components of AI agent architecture are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.\\n\\nQuestion 3: 1. What is the definition of an artificial intelligence (AI) agent?\\n\\n Answer: An artificial intelligence (AI) agent is a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals. The agent makes rational decisions based on its perceptions and data to produce optimal performance and results.\\n\\nQuestion 4: 2. What are the characteristics of a typical AI agent?\\n\\n Answer: A typical AI agent is a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals. It makes rational decisions based on its perceptions and data to produce optimal performance and results. It senses its environment with physical or software interfaces and applies the data to make informed decisions.\\n\\nQuestion 5: 3. How does an AI agent differ from other types of artificial intelligence systems, such as expert systems or neural networks?\\n\\n Answer: AI agents differ from other types of artificial intelligence systems, such as expert systems or neural networks, in that they can interact with their environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals. AI agents make rational decisions based on their perceptions and data to produce optimal performance and results.'"

It is a rational agent that makes decisions based on its perceptions and data to produce optimal performance and results. This means that AI agents can sense their environment through physical or software interfaces, apply the data they collect to make informed decisions, and adjust their actions accordingly.
