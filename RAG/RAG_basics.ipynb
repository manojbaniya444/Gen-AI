Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals. For example, consider a contact center AI agent that wants to resolves customer queries. The agent will automatically ask the customer different questions, look up information in internal documents, and respond with a solution. Based on the customer responses, it determines if it can resolve the query itself or pass it on to a human.\\n\\nWhat are the key principles that define AI agents?\\nAll software autonomously completes different tasks as determined by the software developer. So, what makes AI or intelligent agents special?'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './agent.txt'}, page_content=\"AI agents are rational agents. They make rational decisions based on their perceptions and data to produce optimal performance and results. An AI agent senses its environment with physical or software interfaces.\\n\\nFor example, a robotic agent collects sensor data, and a chatbot uses customer queries as input. Then, the AI agent applies the data to make an informed decision. It analyzes the collected data to predict the best outcomes that support predetermined goals. The agent also uses the results to formulate the next action that it should take. For example, self-driving cars navigate around obstacles on the road based on data from multiple sensors.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of using AI agents?\\nAI agents can improve your business operations and your customers' experiences.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './agent.txt'}, page_content='Improved productivity\\nAI agents are autonomous intelligent systems performing specific tasks without human intervention. Organizations use AI agents to achieve specific goals and more efficient business outcomes. Business teams are more productive when they delegate repetitive tasks to AI agents. This way, they can divert their attention to mission-critical or creative activities, adding more value to their organization.\\n\\nReduced costs\\nBusinesses can use intelligent agents to reduce unnecessary costs arising from process inefficiencies, human errors, and manual processes.

Integrating AI agents allows businesses to personalize product recommendations, provide prompt responses, and innovate to improve customer engagement, conversion, and loyalty. \\n\\nWhat are the key components of AI agent architecture?\\nAgents in artificial intelligence may operate in different environments to accomplish unique purposes.

Meanwhile, an architecture that hosts an AI software agent may use a text prompt, API, and databases to enable autonomous operations. \\n\\nAgent function\\nThe agent function describes how the data collected is translated into actions that support the agentâ€™s objective. When designing the agent function, developers consider the type of information, AI capabilities, knowledge base, feedback mechanism, and other technologies required.\\n\\nAgent program\\nAn agent program is the implementation of the agent function.

Most autonomous agents follow a specific workflow when performing assigned tasks.\\n\\nDetermine goals\\nThe AI agent receives a specific instruction or goal from the user. It uses the goal to plan tasks that make the final outcome relevant and useful to the user. Then, the agent breaks down the goal into several smaller actionable tasks. To achieve the goal, the agent performs those tasks based on specific orders or conditions. \\n\\nAcquire information\\nAI agents need information to act on tasks they have planned successfully. For example, the agent must extract conversation logs to analyze customer sentiments. As such, AI agents might access the internet to search for and retrieve the information they need. In some applications, an intelligent agent can interact with other agents or machine learning models to access or exchange information.'),\n",

Once it accomplishes a task, the agent removes it from the list and proceeds to the next one. In between task completions, the agent evaluates if it has achieved the designated goal by seeking external feedback and inspecting its own logs. During this process, the agent might create and act on more tasks to reach the final outcome. \\n\\nWhat are the challenges of using AI agents?\\nAI agents are helpful software technologies to automate business workflows for better outcomes. That being said, organizations should address the following concerns when deploying autonomous AI agents for business use cases.\\n\\nData privacy concerns\\nDeveloping and operating advanced AI agents requires acquiring, storing, and moving massive volumes of data.

Developers must be able to integrate machine learning libraries with software applications and train the agent with enterprise-specific data. \\n\\nLimited compute resources\\nTraining and deploying deep learning AI agents requires substantial computing resources. When organizations implement these agents on-premise, they must invest in and maintain costly infrastructure that is not easily scalable.')]"

Organizations use AI agents to achieve specific goals and more efficient business outcomes. Business teams are more productive when they delegate repetitive tasks to AI agents. This way, they can divert their attention to mission-critical or creative activities, adding more value to their organization.\\n\\nReduced costs\\nBusinesses can use intelligent agents to reduce unnecessary costs arising from process inefficiencies, human errors, and manual processes. You can confidently perform complex tasks because autonomous agents follow a consistent model that adapts to changing environments.'),\n",

Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals. For example, consider a contact center AI agent that wants to resolves customer queries. The agent will automatically ask the customer different questions, look up information in internal documents, and respond with a solution. Based on the customer responses, it determines if it can resolve the query itself or pass it on to a human.\\n\\nWhat are the key principles that define AI agents?\\nAll software autonomously completes different tasks as determined by the software developer.

Developers must be able to integrate machine learning libraries with software applications and train the agent with enterprise-specific data. \\n\\nLimited compute resources\\nTraining and deploying deep learning AI agents requires substantial computing resources.
